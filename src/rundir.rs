//! Run directory layout (DESIGN.md §15) and run discovery.
//!
//! §15 draws the whole run directory under `.upstroke/runs/<run-id>/`. This
//! module splits it in two, and the reason is enforcement rather than tidiness.
//!
//! A reviewer is a read-only agent pointed at the workspace, so every path
//! inside the workspace is reachable — including, before this split, the
//! implementer's own transcript. Invariant 3 says the diff is ground truth and
//! the transcript is not, so a reviewer reading the transcript is judging the
//! wrong evidence. Permission deny rules cannot close that on their own: gates
//! execute repository code the implementer just wrote, and that code reads any
//! workspace path the deny list never sees.
//!
//! So the split follows what each file is *for*. The ops surface — what
//! `status`, `resume`, `answer`, and any future pane read — stays in the repo
//! where §15 documents it and where CI can collect it. The agent-authored text
//! moves to a user-level directory no sandboxed agent has a path into. The
//! `run_started` event records where that directory is, so the record stays
//! self-describing rather than depending on this function's defaults.
// Allowlist placement: the **funnel section** of `effects/allowlist.toml`, which
// carries this module's review clause -- effects only inside site-taking APIs,
// no writable handle returned. `decisions.effect_site_inventory.mechanism` (2).

/// The lock primitive, and why it is not `std`'s.
///
/// `File::try_lock` is `flock(2)` on Unix, and `flock` locks are held by the
/// *open file description*. `fork` duplicates every descriptor, so a child
/// inherits this lock and keeps holding it until it execs — which means an
/// engine that has finished and let go stays "locked" for as long as some
/// unrelated subprocess spawn is between `fork` and `exec`. Measured: hold a
/// lock, fork, release it, and a fresh probe still reports it taken.
///
/// That was papered over with a 500ms grace — believe contention only if it
/// persists — which is a timing proxy for a property the platform states
/// outright, and only ever probabilistic: a fork window longer than the grace
/// on a loaded machine still refuses a run that nothing is driving, and every
/// `status` of a live run paid the full half-second to find out.
///
/// `fcntl(F_SETLK)` locks are held by the *process*, and are documented not to
/// be inherited across `fork`. The grace disappears rather than being tuned.
///
/// Two things come with that, both measured rather than assumed:
///
/// - They do not exclude the same process from itself, which is what [`claims`]
///   is for.
/// - Closing **any** descriptor for the file releases every lock this process
///   holds on it, so a holder must never open its own lock file again.
///   [`is_running`] answers from [`claims`] before it would.
///
/// `F_OFD_SETLK` is not an escape from the first two: it is scoped to the open
/// file description, exactly like `flock`, and is inherited across `fork` in
/// exactly the same way.
///
/// Windows has neither hazard — `LockFileEx` is per-handle and there is no
/// `fork` — so it keeps std's implementation and this module is where the two
/// meet.
