//! P0–P8 — creating a schema-4 run, and the one deletion boundary.

//! > under the worktree lock a fresh run then proceeds in this order, **each
//! > step a registered site**: P0 create the public run directory
//! > (`RunDir.CreatePublicDir`); P1 publish the `.creating` marker atomically …

//!
//! That is O04–O16, and this module is those clauses and nothing else. It
//! resolves nothing (that is [`super::prelock`]), censuses nothing, and runs no
//! loop.
//!
//! # The typestate
//!
//! Each prefix is a type in [`steps`]. Every one has private fields, derives no
//! `Clone`, `Copy` or `Default`, and has exactly one constructor, which takes
//! its predecessor **by value**. So P5b cannot be reached without P4 having
//! returned, and a witness cannot be duplicated to authorise a step twice. The
//! root of the chain is [`PreLockChecked`], which is itself unforgeable, so the
//! run id, the incarnation and the `RunnerPolicy` this sequence publishes are —
//! as a matter of type, not of review — the ones resolved before the worktree
//! lock.
//!
//! # The deletion boundary
//!
//! There is exactly one, it is the existence of `<private>/committed.json`, and
//! [`stat_after_error`] is the only place this module can delete anything. It
//! stats fail-closed, proves, and spends the proof token **in one call**, so no
//! proof value and no stat result ever crosses P5b in a local variable.
//!
//! Three consequences, each settled and each a separate test:
//!
//! * **At P3a the creator removes neither half.** ST-19: "P3a: the private
//!   directory exists without an owner record — unprovable — so **both halves
//!   are retained and reported** (content-free by ordering; deferred prune)".
//!   This needs no special case: `prove_private_half_ownership` already answers
//!   `Retained(OwnerRecordMissing)` for exactly that shape, and a `Retained`
//!   answer deletes nothing. Removing the public half instead — which an earlier
//!   draft did — would orphan the private one **permanently**, because the only
//!   production `read_dir` over a runs root is `rundir::run_dir_names` over
//!   `<repo>/.upstroke/runs` and the private half is reachable only through the
//!   marker inside the public husk.
//! * **The public half goes only if the private one went.** The same argument
//!   one step later: on the proven path the removal is ordered private-half
//!   first and public directory last, and `remove_public_husk` deletes
//!   `<public>/.creating` with it. So a `RunDir.RemovePrivateHusk` that returns
//!   `Err` short-circuits — removing the public half anyway would delete the
//!   private half's only locator on exactly the path where the private half may
//!   still be there. Retained, the pair is reachable in **all three** shapes a
//!   failed `remove_dir_all` can leave, which is what the short-circuit buys:
//!   the next census proves the pair and reclaims both if the private half
//!   survived intact; reclaims the public husk alone (`TargetAbsent`) if the
//!   whole private half went and the error came on the way out; and — the shape
//!   the arm exists for, an unwritable parent or a Windows handle on the
//!   directory itself — **retains the pair, reported**, when every child was
//!   removed and the directory was not, because the marker's target then exists
//!   with no `owner.json` in it and the proof answers `OwnerRecordMissing`. Two
//!   of the three converge by reclaiming and the third by reporting; none of
//!   them orphans anything, which is the property the short-circuit is for.
//! * **From the moment `committed.json` exists the creator deletes nothing**,
//!   including when `publish_commit_record` returned `Err` and a read-only stat
//!   shows the record present, and including when the stat cannot answer.
//! * **The creator uses the existing `PrivateHalfProof` constructor.** Every
//!   conjunct of `prove_private_half_ownership` passes for the creator at
//!   P3b–P5 — it published both records itself, one incarnation ago — so a
//!   second constructor would buy nothing and would cost the field privacy six
//!   compile-fail fixtures rest on.
//!
//! # The boundary's scope, stated
//!
//! The boundary is a rule about **run-lifecycle paths** — every path in this
//! module, and every path a census takes: nothing that reaches a run directory
//! *as a run directory* deletes a private half once `committed.json` exists.
//! That is the scope the sentence has always had; it is written down here
//! because the test build now carries the one thing outside it.
//!
//! `rundir::scratch_tree` reclaims a tree a **test** minted. Its token binds a
//! root that did not exist before the token did — `acquire` creates it with a
//! non-recursive exclusive create and refuses an occupied or undecidable one —
//! so nothing beneath that root predates the token, and a `committed.json`
//! found there is a fixture the holder published rather than a run's boundary.
//! It is on none of the paths above: the module is `#[cfg(test)]`, it takes no
//! `RunDirSite` and adds no row to `effect_sites.json`, it cannot mint or
//! weaken a `PrivateHalfProof`, and it has no way to reach
//! `remove_private_husk`. Conjunct 12 is unmoved and still fail-closed: the
//! witness in `rundir::tests` named for a scratch tree holding a committed
//! record shows one directory answered by both authorities — the proof retains
//! it as `PossiblyCommitted`, and the scratch token reclaims it.
//! `decisions/2026-08-30-test-scratch-tree-ownership.md` is the record, and
//! states the completeness rule in its two-token form.
//!
//! # `RunPaths::create_hooked` is not used here
//!
//! It creates the five private skeleton directories **before** the owner
//! record. O08 is "owner record before any other private content and before any
//! probe", so using it would put five directories on the wrong side of the
//! record and make the P3a residue five directories rather than an empty one.
//! Its only production caller is the legacy coordinator.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The two seams P4 and P8 need
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// P4's `RunnerPreflight`, as this module drives it.
///
/// INV-23: "one non-slotted shell probe (the recorded shell executing `exit 0`)
/// and one slotted probe per recorded agent, each a registered invocation
/// **through the run's Runner**". The asymmetry is why these are two methods —
/// the shell probe takes the identity this module minted and no slot, an agent
/// probe takes a slot and is driven by its adapter, which mints the probe
/// identities of its own pre-flight processes.
///
/// A seam rather than a concrete `&dyn Runner` plus a `&dyn AdapterSource`
/// because the *ordering* is what this module owns and the ordering is only
/// observable if a test can see which probe ran first. [`RunnerProbes`] is the
/// production implementation and is a thin composition of two existing
/// functions.
/// The grant P4 hands its probes — R4's invocation ledger, which carries R3's slot table since
/// PR11's broker put the two in one ledger — as **one value**.
///
/// **The unit of the grant is the pair, so the pair is a type.** They were two
/// fields on the creation request beside a `&dyn Probes`, and nothing required
/// the probes to use them: an implementation could run its processes through a
/// pair of its own and let the closing balance inspect the supplied one. Moving
/// them onto the trait did not fix it either — a trait exposing `agent()`
/// beside `ledger()` cannot force `agent()` to use what the accessor returns —
/// and the `b1f54a5` review constructed exactly that. Both attempts phrased the
/// obligation as a claim about a *signature*, which is what
/// `PR7-G2-W1-PROBE-PAIR-NOT-OBLIGED` recorded as asserted-and-refuted four
/// times.
///
/// What is structural, and stated no wider than it is: the caller grants the
/// pair, builds the registration capability from it, and hands the probe **the
/// capability** rather than its ingredients. A probe receives a
/// [`ShellProbe`] or an [`AgentProbe`] — types whose fields are private to this
/// module and whose only constructors are [`Self::shell_probe`] and
/// [`Self::agent_probe`] — so the pair a probe registers into is the pair its
/// caller bound, and the production implementation has no runner, ledger or
/// slots of its own from which a second one could be built.
///
/// It is not a claim about every possible `impl Probes`: a test double may hold
/// whatever it likes and simply *not register*, which is what
/// `ContainerProbes` does. That is a probe running nothing through the run's
/// boundary, which the closing balance sees as an empty ledger — a different
/// failure from the one this closes, and one the fixture asserts on its own.
