//! The emit path and the append-error protocol.
//!
//! Everything here drives the **shared** [`HookHarness`] through
//! [`HarnessTopologyHooks`], never a private observer, because half of what
//! these tests assert is an *absence* — "no promotion, CAS, cleanup, admission,
//! report" — and an absence measured on an observer only one family reports to
//! is an absence of evidence rather than evidence of absence. Every such
//! assertion here is paired with a **control** that drives the very site it
//! claims did not run, through the same harness, so a vacuous scan fails.
//!
//! Three constraints shaped the file and are worth stating once:
//!
//! * `src/engine/topology/**` is a `TOPOLOGY_MODULE`. Raw `std::fs` mutation
//!   and `std::process::Command` are on the effect denylist **in tests too**,
//!   so every byte on disk here arrives through a funnel: the run directories
//!   through [`RunPaths::create`], the log through `Event.OpenLog`, the lines
//!   through `Event.Append*`, the commit record through
//!   `RunDir.{Stage,Publish}CommitRecord`. Which means the fault shapes are the
//!   **error-return** halves of `T-APPEND` — (e-w), (e-u), (e-s) — and the kill
//!   halves (w), (u), (s) are `src/events/log/tests.rs`'s, beside the kill
//!   apparatus that already exists there.
//! * A function may not be its own oracle. "Whether the proven prefix contains
//!   the line" is checked here against bytes read back off disk with
//!   [`std::fs::read`], never against [`AppendOutcome`].
//! * Cumulative ledgers hide orderings (`PR5-WORKSPACE-022`). Every ordering
//!   assertion below clears its ledger first and reads the sequence that
//!   follows.
