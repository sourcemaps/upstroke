//! What an exact snapshot is checked out at, and what one is once it exists.
//!
//! `decisions.workspace_candidates.snapshots` distinguishes the two inputs a
//! snapshot can be taken of -- an existing commit, for which no object is
//! created, and a tree, for which the funnel first writes an ephemeral commit
//! on the recorded parent. [`SnapshotInput`] is that distinction as a value and
//! [`Snapshot`] is what the funnel returns; the funnel, the ephemeral
//! commit-tree it may run, and the ref discipline around it are the parent's.
//!
//! **Every id here is an [`ObjectId`]** (§5): the spelling of a full
//! hexadecimal object id of either hash length that is not the null id,
//! checked once where the value enters and carried as a type after that. The
//! funnel hands `git commit-tree` and `git worktree add` these values as
//! arguments, and Git resolves whatever it is given -- a ref name checks out
//! wherever that ref points at the moment, which is not an *exact* snapshot,
//! and a short or option-shaped string is parsed as something else. The type
//! removes those spellings. It cannot remove a ref *spelt* as hexadecimal of
//! the other object format's length (a branch named with forty hexadecimal
//! characters in a SHA-256 repository, and the inverse), because the type
//! does not know the repository; measured on git 2.43, `git worktree add
//! --detach <that name>` checks out wherever the branch points. So the funnel
//! resolves each input once against the repository (`rev-parse --verify
//! --quiet <id>^{commit}` or `^{tree}`) and accepts only an answer equal to
//! the input: a ref, an abbreviation, an id of the other format's length and
//! a missing object all resolve to something else or to nothing, and are
//! refused by name ([`Refusal::SnapshotInputResolvesElsewhere`]) before any
//! intent is written. What a [`Snapshot`] holds is therefore what Git
//! resolved to itself. The predicate is the parent's [`is_object_id`], the
//! well-formedness half of `design/26` step 5; the null id is refused too,
//! because that step measures it as a condition rather than an id, and no
//! object can be snapshotted at it.
//!
//! **Resolving to itself is not the whole of exactness.** `git replace A B`
//! makes Git read `B` wherever `A` is named while `rev-parse` still prints
//! `A`, so the check above passes and the checkout would materialise `B`
//! (measured, git 2.43). Every command the *manager* runs carries
//! [`NO_REPLACEMENT_OBJECTS`](crate::workspace_manager::NO_REPLACEMENT_OBJECTS),
//! set where those commands are built, so the funnel writes and checks out the
//! objects the repository holds: the snapshot's own filesystem is the judged
//! tree.
//!
//! **And the same pair reaches every other process that inspects it.** A gate
//! or a reviewer running *inside* the snapshot inherits nothing -- its runner
//! clears the ambient environment and composes its own -- and neither does
//! `read_only_git`, which `quiescence` uses; measured, a role process running
//! `git show HEAD:f` in the snapshot read the replacement, and `git status
//! --porcelain` called an untouched snapshot modified. Both runners' `compose`
//! name the same constant, and so does `read_only_git` -- which is the whole of
//! the free read path, because `read_only_git_ok` reaches Git only through it
//! -- so an exact snapshot is exact on disk and exact for every process
//! upstroke starts over it.
//! `design/15_design_event_log_resume_run_layout.md`, "What an exact snapshot
//! is exact against", is the product sentence: a snapshot is exact against the
//! objects the repository holds, and no adapter, image or overlay can turn that
//! off. The v0.1 conductor's runner reads the other graph, which costs this
//! nothing: no snapshot of this manager is ever taken on that path.
//!
//! **What a [`Snapshot`] holds together** (§5, §6): its fields are private
//! and it has one constructor, [`Snapshot::new`], visible to the parent only.
//! The slot is built from the [`SnapshotName`] the constructor is given, so it
//! is a snapshot slot and never a task or staging one, which is what
//! `remove_snapshot` relies on when it removes the slot the value names. The
//! HEAD is one [`SnapshotHead`], so the ephemeral commit, when there is one,
//! *is* the HEAD rather than a second field that has to agree with it. The
//! checkout path is what `git worktree add` returned for that slot; the type
//! cannot re-derive it without the execution root, so the guarantee there is
//! the private field and the single construction site inside the funnel.
//!
//! **§6.** Nothing here is shared, locked or cloned. [`ObjectId`] and
//! [`SnapshotInput`] are small owned values and derive `Clone`, since an input
//! is built once and may be offered to more than one add. [`Snapshot`] does
//! not: it names one live checkout, and a copy of it would be two values for
//! one resource, of which `remove_snapshot` can only ever remove one. Equality
//! on all three is equality of the canonical spelling, which after the
//! funnel's resolution is equality of the object; the tests use it.

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
// level is scoped by the module tree rather than by the file, so an out-of-line
// child of `src/workspace_manager.rs` inherits that file's inner
// `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
// unless it says otherwise -- `PR6-LANEF-004`, and the mistake two W1 pull
// requests then made independently (#100 and #102). Nothing here reaches a
// governed primitive, so all three are DENIED and this module takes no
// `effects/allowlist.toml` row: a row records an allowance, and this module
// takes none.
