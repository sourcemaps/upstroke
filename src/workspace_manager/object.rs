//! Object-id vocabulary, and the refusals every ref transition is gated on.
//!
//! **The well-formedness half of the ref rule** (`design/26` step 5: a full
//! hexadecimal object id on both sides, the null id refused on either).
//! `update-ref` is given ids, not references: a malformed one is refused before
//! any funnel runs, and the null id is refused on both sides of an update,
//! because measured on git 2.43 it does not mean "this id" on either. As the expected-old,
//! `update-ref -d <ref> 0{40}` deletes *unconditionally* rather than failing the
//! compare-and-swap the caller believed it had written. As the new value,
//! `update-ref <ref> 0{40} <old>` succeeds and **deletes** the ref when `<old>`
//! matches, and `update-ref <ref> 0{40} ""` succeeds and creates nothing when
//! the ref is absent (a mismatched old value, or an existing ref on the create
//! path, exits 128 and preserves the ref, as for any new value): the null id
//! there means "must not exist afterwards", which turns a compare-and-swap into
//! a guarded delete and a create into a reported success with no ref behind it.
//! The transitions themselves -- create, move, delete, and the merge-queue
//! CAS -- are the parent's funnels.
//!
//! **§6 and §7.** Nothing here is shared, locked or cloned: a refusal copies
//! the ref name and the offered value into the [`Refusal`] it returns, which is
//! the owned snapshot an error value is. The refusals return the [`Refusal`]
//! itself rather than the parent's flattened `UpstrokeError`, so a caller or a
//! test can match the variant; the parent's `?` sites convert through its own
//! `From<Refusal>`. The two `?` in this file are same-type propagation of a
//! refusal that already says everything a reader of the failure needs, and
//! each says so at its site.

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
// level is scoped by the module tree rather than by the file, so an out-of-line
// child of `src/workspace_manager.rs` inherits that file's inner
// `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
// unless it says otherwise -- `PR6-LANEF-004`, and the mistake two W1 pull
// requests then made independently (#100 and #102). Nothing here reaches a
// governed primitive, so all three are DENIED and this module takes no
// `effects/allowlist.toml` row: a row records an allowance, and this module
