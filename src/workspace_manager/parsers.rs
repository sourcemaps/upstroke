//! both read by splitting on the zero byte -- and the third is not: the `gitdir`
//! file of a linked-worktree registration holds **one textual path**, which
//! [`registration_checkout`] trims of exactly the trailing bytes Git trims and
//! decodes whole. They are functions over bytes so that the hostile cases -- an
//! undecodable path, an embedded newline, a truncated record, a registration
//! that names something outside the root -- can be exercised on every platform
//! rather than only on the one whose filesystem can hold them.
//!
//! Every grammar here refuses rather than admits, to the extent its tests
//! prove: a field that is not the grammar, a record cut short, a path this
//! platform cannot spell exactly, an attribute whose value its own grammar
//! forbids, and a changed path that is not one normalised repository path are
//! each named at the point they are seen, never dropped, skipped over or read
//! as something shorter. What a refusal becomes is decided once per grammar,
//! at the one site that knows the caller's action, and that site says so. The
//! one thing skipped on purpose is an attribute label this module does not
//! know, because Git may add one.
//!
//! The commands whose output these read are run by the parent, inside its
//! funnels; nothing here starts a process or touches a path.

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint

// unless it says otherwise -- `PR6-LANEF-004`, and the mistake two W1 pull
// requests then made independently (#100 and #102). Nothing here reaches a

/// The path is taken as bytes through [`decode_path`], because a repository
/// path need not be UTF-8 on Unix and a lossy spelling is not the path; under
/// `-z` it is verbatim, and a space is a legal byte of one. This parser owns
/// the framing: `HEAD` and `branch` carry a value and `detached` and `bare`
/// are labels with no value. Every other rule is the record's own, applied
/// by [`OpenRecord`] as each attribute is fed to it, in attribute order, so
/// a record with two attributes outside the grammar is refused for the first
/// one read: `HEAD` is an object id, `branch` is a refname's byte set (which
/// forbids whitespace) and is kept as the bytes Git printed, no attribute
/// appears twice in a record, and `locked` and `prunable` carry the bytes of
/// Git's own reason (which may include a newline, one reason `-z` exists),
/// consulted only for the word `initializing`. `OpenRecord::close` then
/// refuses a set of attributes that is not a worktree -- neither bare nor a
/// HEAD with exactly one of `branch` and `detached` -- and this function
/// names the record it refused. A label this parser does not know is skipped,
/// since Git may add one.
