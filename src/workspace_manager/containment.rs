//! Path hygiene: reparse points, the verbatim prefix, and the canonical
//! comparisons containment is decided by.
//!
//! `DESIGN.md` §15 creates an execution root only when the managed base is a
//! real directory and the chain from the authorized private root down to the
//! root carries no symlink, reparse point or regular file, and every
//! containment answer in the parent is a comparison of two
//! [`canonical_prefix`] results. Those predicates are here; the revalidation
//! that calls them before each effect funnel and again inside it, and every
//! effect it guards, is the parent's.
//!
//! **Read-only, and that is why it can be a child.** `fs::symlink_metadata` and
//! `fs::canonicalize` observe; neither is a governed primitive, and no function
//! here creates, renames, or removes anything.

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
// level is scoped by the module tree rather than by the file, so an out-of-line
// child of `src/workspace_manager.rs` inherits that file's inner
// `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
// unless it says otherwise -- `PR6-LANEF-004`, and the mistake two W1 pull
// requests then made independently (#100 and #102). Nothing here reaches a
// governed primitive, so all three are DENIED and this module takes no
// `effects/allowlist.toml` row: a row records an allowance, and this module

/// `DESIGN.md` §15 requires no symlink or reparse point on the chain, and a
/// chain has to start somewhere. It starts at the operator's own authorized
/// root, canonicalized: §15 records the execution root as
/// `<private root>/workspaces/<repo-key>/<run-id>`, so the private root is
/// the anchor and everything below it is the run's. The root is resolved at
/// `derive` and re-examined at every
/// revalidation by [`refuse_reparse_points`]: it must still be a real
/// directory and still canonicalize to itself, or the chain has moved under
/// the run. What must be reparse-free is everything the run itself builds
/// beneath it.
///
/// The unanchored reading was tried and is wrong on a real platform, not just
/// inconvenient: macOS ships `/var` as a symlink to `private/var` and its
/// `$TMPDIR` lives under it, so an operator whose private root is anywhere
/// under `/var` — including every default temporary directory on that OS —
/// would have every run refused for a link they did not create and cannot
/// remove. No live passage asks for that, and the containment the refusal
/// exists to protect is unaffected. The subsystem's two recursive deletions
/// are the parent's: a worktree's tree, which goes through
/// [`WorkspaceManager::contained`](super::WorkspaceManager::contained) and so
/// compares **canonical** paths, and that worktree's Git admin entry, which
/// `revalidate_removal` bound to the same slot byte-for-byte before anything
/// was deleted. A resolved link cannot carry either outside the root. The
/// parent's other removals never recurse — `remove_dir` on the root and its
/// own empty scaffolding, `remove_file` on an intent, and on the `locked`
/// marker inside that admin entry — but a non-recursive removal still
/// follows a link in its *parent*, and so does every read and every write.
/// So each funnel primitive names, as data, the paths of nine roles it acts
/// through after its `Before` hook — the parent's
/// [`Primitive::acted_through`](super::Primitive::acted_through): the
/// effect's target, its parent chain, Git's hooks path, the intent it
/// authorises on, the registration it removes — and one helper walks that
/// set with this predicate immediately before the syscalls. An exchanged
/// `intents/`, `tasks/`, `hooks-none` or admin directory refuses exactly as
/// an exchanged root does. The table is those nine roles and no more: Git's
/// own repository-discovery paths — the `.git` file or link of the checkout
/// and of the base, and `commondir`, `objects`, `refs`, `packed-refs`,
/// `index` and `config` behind them — are not walked, and the two
/// commit-tree funnels have no entry. That is the parent's funnel design
/// and its sweep's; the durable fix is directory-handle-relative operations
/// or a stated trust boundary for what may write inside the execution root.
///
/// Only components that exist are inspected: a root that has not been created
/// yet has an absent leaf, and refusing on absence would refuse every first
/// run. A regular file on the chain is **not** absence. Nothing below it can
/// ever exist, so walking past it hands the failure to whichever effect comes
/// next — or to none: `remove_execution_root` asks `exists()`, which folds
/// the file into "nothing to remove". The walk reports the file where it
/// stands instead, as `NotADirectory` at its own path, and reports it the
/// same on every platform: it reads the component's type rather than waiting
/// for the `ENOTDIR` only Unix raises one component later. `chain` is plain
/// components by construction ([`plain_chain_below`]), so the walk has no
/// root to skip and no `..` to climb.
///

/// where a directory must be, with its path. `leaf` says what the last
