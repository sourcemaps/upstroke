//! What Git reports about a linked worktree, and what
//! [`WorkspaceManager::verify_worktree`](super::WorkspaceManager::verify_worktree)
//! demands of one before it is reused.
//!
//! These are the three values that conversation is held in -- the record Git
//! hands back, the quiescence the caller asks for, and the reasons the answer
//! can be no. The verification itself runs a Git child and is the parent's; the
//! record is produced by `parsers.rs`, which reads the `--porcelain -z` framing
//! and feeds each attribute to an [`OpenRecord`], and this module holds the
//! grammar of the record itself.
//!
//! **What this module does not state.** Which conditions a reuse must meet is
//! the parent's `verify_worktree`, and where that rule comes from is
//! `DESIGN.md`'s to say. The tree cites a decision record retired on
//! 2026-09-03 for it, at 51 sites, and `DESIGN.md`'s retired-records table
//! maps no such record to a section (`SWEEP-WORKTREE-014`, for the owner).
//! Until it does, nothing here quotes that record: these types document what
//! they are and what the code does with them, and no more.

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
// level is scoped by the module tree rather than by the file, so an out-of-line
// child of `src/workspace_manager.rs` inherits that file's inner
// `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
// unless it says otherwise -- `PR6-LANEF-004`, and the mistake two W1 pull
// requests then made independently (#100 and #102). Nothing here reaches a
// governed primitive, so all three are DENIED and this module takes no
// `effects/allowlist.toml` row: a row records an allowance, and this module
