//! The read-only residue classifier: what a killed Git command left behind, and
//! whether it is the after-phase publication or the interrupted prefix.
//!
//! `decisions.effect_site_inventory.command_internal_sub_effects` writes the
//! predicate as `classify_object_residue(site, worktree)` and defines
//! `ObjectResidue::Internal` by it. The order this module implements is that
//! sentence's: the after-phase reference decides `After` first, and only its
//! absence lets residue decide `Internal`.
//!
//! **Read-only throughout.** Nothing here writes an object, moves a ref, or
//! touches an index -- a classifier that had to *compute* a content-addressed
//! name would be performing the very effect it is classifying, which is why
//! [`ResidueTarget::published`] carries the parent's record instead. The Git
//! inspections it reads through (`git fsck --unreachable`, `rev-parse --verify
//! --quiet`, `worktree list`, `status`, `diff --cached`) are the parent's
//! helpers, and so is every process start.
//!
//! **§6 and §7.** No shared ownership, lock or clone: [`ResidueTarget`] is
//! four borrows and is `Copy`. Every `?` in this module propagates the
//! parent's `UpstrokeError` unchanged, and each is deliberate in §7's sense:
//! the helper that failed already names what a reader of the failure needs
//! (the git command and the worktree it ran in, or the path an I/O error was
//! about); the crate's error type has no variant that wraps one error in
//! another, so a `map_err` here would flatten an `Io` into a `Git` message and
//! lose its kind; and the classifier's callers (`candidate::verify_object`,
//! `WorkspaceManager::quiescence`, the sampling harnesses) propagate or record
//! the error rather than match on it. What the module decides itself is the
//! one thing §7 puts on it: **an inspection that fails is an error, never an
//! answer.** Every residue name is read through [`name_present`], which makes
//! only an actual not-found "absent"; a permission failure, a symlink loop or
//! a transient I/O error is an `Io` error naming the name. Before the sweep
//! every name went through `Path::exists`, which answers `false` for all of
//! those, so a git dir this process could not search classified as `None`.
//!
//! **What this module cannot promise, and where the promise belongs.** The
//! line above holds for the names this module reads itself. It does not hold
//! for what it reads *through*: the parent's inspections still fold some Git
//! failures into an answer before the `?` here ever sees them — a failed
//! `cat-file`, a `show-ref` that could not run, a `fsck` that did not finish.
//! Making those trustworthy means reading a repository the way Git reads it
//! (its gitfile grammar, its trace-polluted streams, with a bound on every
//! read of a repository-controlled file), which is the parent's work and not
//! a child classifier's: `findings/` carries a file per case for the sweep of
//! `src/workspace_manager.rs`, the queue's last row of this family, and
//! `reviews/FINDINGS.md` §51 is where they were derived. The one inspection
//! this module used to make through `git worktree list` — whether the
//! repository registers the worktree — is now the parent's byte-safe read of
//! the store itself (`registration_for`), since a registration an interrupted
//! add left half-written is exactly what that enumeration cannot report.

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
// level is scoped by the module tree rather than by the file, so an out-of-line
// child of `src/workspace_manager.rs` inherits that file's inner
// `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
// unless it says otherwise -- `PR6-LANEF-004`, and the mistake two W1 pull
// requests then made independently (#100 and #102). Nothing here reaches a
// governed primitive, so all three are DENIED and this module takes no
// `effects/allowlist.toml` row: a row records an allowance, and this module
// takes none.
