//! every primitive in the parent goes through it.
//!
//! **The protocol, not the effects.** Nothing here opens a file, starts a

//! the parent supplies it, so every effect site in this module tree stays in
//! `src/workspace_manager.rs` where the allowlist row and the reviewed

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
// level is scoped by the module tree rather than by the file, so an out-of-line
// child of `src/workspace_manager.rs` inherits that file's inner
// `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
