/// the sampler kills a real `git` child at an unseeded point and *sometimes*
/// leaves a handle, so it proves the condition exists but cannot be re-run to
/// prove a fix. Here the handle is held on purpose.
///
/// **The oracle is the attempt count, not the clock and not the outcome.** Both
/// cases assert that the removal made more than one attempt, reading the count
/// from `fixture::observe_removal_attempts`; the primitive records an attempt
/// after it has returned and before its result is interpreted. Everything else
/// in this test exists to make that count mean something.
///
/// The first version had no such reading and could not get one: nothing outside
/// the loop can see an attempt, and the funnel's `Before` phase — the closest
/// seam a test otherwise has — fires *before* the primitive is entered. So the
/// closing case asserted the retry indirectly, by expecting a removal to
/// succeed against a handle it *believed* was open on the first attempt. That
/// belief is a scheduling assumption, and the frontier pass on `86fa1d8` showed
/// it is unsound in both directions:
///
/// * **The retry-deleted mutant survived.** Deschedule the remover between the
///   hook and the loop, let the holder's timed release expire first, and the
///   single remaining attempt succeeds unaided. `ATTEMPTS = 1` then passes.
/// * **And correct code could fail.** The same interleaving, unmutated, is a
///   removal that never needed the retry, which the old oracle also could not
///   tell from one that did.
///
/// Reading the count settles both, and the release is now driven from the same
/// seam. The holder does not close on a timer or on the funnel's signal; it
/// closes when it is told that **attempt 1 has already completed**, and the
/// observer then waits for the close before letting the loop continue. So
/// attempt 1 provably ran with the handle open, attempt 2 provably ran after it
/// closed, and neither fact depends on which thread the scheduler favours. The
/// 300ms hold and the five-second timer that preceded it are both gone, and
/// with them `FIND-109-CLOSING-CASE-HOLDER-STARVATION`, which existed only
/// because the release could not be ordered against an attempt.
///
/// The **held** case is the other half, and it is where the retry has to stop:
/// a handle held past the whole budget is a locked worktree, and reporting it
/// is the behaviour a retry that waits forever would destroy. That case never
/// releases until the assertions have run, so "was the handle still open?" is
/// not a question about scheduling there — the only thing that can close it is
/// `Holder`'s drop.
///
/// **Every wait is bounded, and bounded by one deadline rather than one each.**
/// `FAIL_SAFE` is taken once, before the holder starts, and every receive in
/// the test and in the holder waits only for what is left of it. The previous
/// shape gave each of the holder's two receives its own 600 seconds, so a

/// `std::result::Result<…>`, is **invisible to it**: the derived set, this
/// grid and the scan's own positive control all stay green while that
/// primitive turns caller data into a path with nothing refusing for it. The
/// `seen_fns > 30` check below is a floor that says the scan read something,
/// not a boundary that says it read everything, and §12 asks for the second.

/// What `git worktree add` leaves when it is killed before it writes `gitdir`,
/// and what `remove_worktree` does with it. Measured under strace on git
/// 2.43.0, the add writes in this order: the admin directory, `locked`
/// (`initializing`), the checkout directory, `gitdir`, the checkout's `.git`
/// pointer, `HEAD`, `commondir`, then the checkout through child processes; on
/// the run measured, `locked` was unlinked as the last syscall. A kill between
/// opening `gitdir` -- which creates it, zero-length -- and writing it leaves
/// exactly an admin directory holding `locked` and a zero-length `gitdir`, and
/// an empty checkout directory with no pointer.
///
/// Three facts, each asserted because each was believed otherwise once.
///
/// The classifier answers `None` for it, and that answer is a **hole**, not a
/// verdict: `None` is defined as "nothing was written", and here an intent,
/// an admin directory, `locked`, `gitdir` and a checkout directory were
/// written. The classifier reads registration through `git worktree list`,
/// which skips a registration it reads zero bytes from, so `record_for`
/// answers `None`, the element list is empty, and the state is invisible to
/// the site's residue contract even though it is durable. The sampler runs
/// the tabled recovery for every sample and requires every one to recover, so
/// a sample landing in this window is the sampler's `forced removal
/// converges` red.
///
/// `remove_worktree` **refuses** it, with a diagnostic naming this admin
/// directory and nothing else, and the residue blocks every removal through
/// this funnel in the repository, not only this slot's. That is pinned as what
/// the public `WorkspaceManager` library API does today. The shipped CLI's
/// `upstroke resume` uses the separate `Workspace::reclaim_gate_workspaces`
/// path, which never decodes a registration's `gitdir`; this test does not
/// reproduce a refusal in that path. `DESIGN.md` §15's reclaim sentence is
/// about those gate/review worktrees. The engine's task-slot callers are in
/// its crate-private schema-4 topology, and `reclaim_intents` has no non-test
/// caller within this repository, but external library callers can use the
/// public manager directly.
/// The design is silent about a task registration this funnel cannot bind;
/// `RESIDUE-UNBINDABLE-TASK-REGISTRATION-HAS-NO-DESIGN-SENTENCE` records that
/// gap and the measurements a sentence needs. On disk this state is
/// indistinguishable from an add in flight in the same window -- `locked` is
/// present in both -- and a skip here was measured to delete the checkout
/// beneath a live writer's registration (PR #151 pass 1), so the refusal is
/// not to be relaxed on disk state alone. What relaxes it is a proof about
/// writers, `WriterProof::NoWriterAlive`, and the sibling
/// `a_torn_registration_is_passed_over_and_the_slot_converges_when_no_writer_is_alive`
/// holds that form to what it may and may not touch.
///
/// What each refusal is checked against is a snapshot -- relative path to
/// directory, bytes or link target -- of four trees, taken before and compared
/// whole after: the unrelated slot's populated checkout, this slot's empty
/// checkout directory, the whole `.git/worktrees/` store (the stale entry and
/// the unrelated slot's administrative directory alike), and the intents
/// directory. The same four trees at both refusals; the unrelated slot exists
/// before the first. Checking named files would let a removal that deleted
/// the rest pass, and checking the checkout without its administrative
/// directory would let a removal that deleted the unrelated slot's `index`
/// pass.

///   between the seed and the base, so that diff carries it and this one
///   must not.
/// * **`--binary`.** Witnessed against dropping it from
///   [`crate::workspace::REVIEW_DIFF_FLAGS`]: Git then says "Binary files …
///   differ", which is not a patch a reviewer or `classify::diff_failure` can
///   read.
/// * **Colour suppression.** The repository is configured `color.ui=always`,
///   which is exactly the operator config the flag list exists to defeat, and
///   `WorkspaceManager::command` sets no colour option of its own. The witness
///   is dropping **both** `-c color.ui=false` and `--no-color`, and it is

///   suppressing colour, and a claim measured against a mutation that does not
///   bite is not a measurement. Witnessed against dropping the pair: the diff
///   comes back carrying escape codes.
///
/// `--no-ext-diff` and `--no-textconv` need an external program or a
/// `.gitattributes` filter to observe; they are a deferred row rather than
/// half a test.
