//! The slot names, the snapshot names, and the intent record they are written
//! into.
//!
//! `decisions.workspace_candidates.manager` names two of the three namespaces
//! literally -- "detached linked worktrees with durable synced intents
//! (`tasks/k<key>-g<gen>`, `merge/s<seq>`)" -- and
//! `decisions.workspace_candidates.snapshots` requires the third's members to be
//! "never reused across roles or attempts".
//!
//! **Containment is structural; uniqueness is not, and the difference is worth
//! stating exactly.** [`safe_component`] is what makes a [`Slot`] path
//! containment-by-construction — a name that could escape the execution root is
//! refused, whatever produced it. Uniqueness across roles and attempts is a
//! weaker guarantee: [`SnapshotName`]'s three constructors encode the role, the
//! generation and the attempt into the name, so a caller that goes through them
//! cannot collide — but they are not the only way to obtain one.
//! [`Slot::from_intent_name`] reconstructs a [`Slot::Snapshot`] straight from an
//! on-disk intent filename, so that reclaim never has to trust a path stored
//! inside a record, and a name reconstructed that way carries whatever the
//! filename carried. **So "never reused across roles or attempts" rests on
//! caller discipline rather than on the type**, and this module documents that
//! rather than claiming a guarantee it does not provide.
//!
//! Pure string and path arithmetic. Nothing in this module reads or writes the
//! filesystem; the funnels that act on the paths it names are the parent's.
//!
//! **[`Slot`]'s five effect-site accessors are deliberately not here.** `row`,
//! `add_site`, `write_intent_site`, `remove_site` and `remove_intent_site` map a
//! slot to the [`EffectSiteId`](crate::topology::effects::EffectSiteId) its
//! funnel runs under, which is effect-site vocabulary rather than naming, and
//! `effects::tests::every_site_the_inventory_declares_has_a_funnel_that_names_
//! it_or_is_recorded_absent` reads `src/workspace_manager.rs` **by path** for
//! exactly those eleven variant literals. They stay in the parent, in a second
//! `impl Slot` block beside the module declaration, so that census keeps
//! measuring what it measured before the split.

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
// level is scoped by the module tree rather than by the file, so an out-of-line
// child of `src/workspace_manager.rs` inherits that file's inner
// `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
// unless it says otherwise -- `PR6-LANEF-004`, and the mistake two W1 pull
// requests then made independently (#100 and #102). Nothing here reaches a
// governed primitive, so all three are DENIED and this module takes no
// `effects/allowlist.toml` row: a row records an allowance, and this module
// takes none.
