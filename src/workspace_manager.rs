//! `WorkspaceManager` — the typed funnels for the execution root, the detached
//! worktrees, the exact snapshots, the engine refs, and the Git-object creation
//! contexts.
//!
//! `decisions.workspace_candidates.manager`: "WorkspaceManager
//! (src/workspace_manager.rs) owns execution-root derivation and containment,
//! detached linked worktrees with durable synced intents (tasks/k<key>-g<gen>,
//! merge/s<seq>), exact snapshot worktrees with intents, engine refs, byte-safe
//! changed-path capture, worktree quiescence verification, object-residue
//! classification, and forced removal; the user's checkout is read only for
//! base capture; every worktree, snapshot, ref, pin, Git object, lock,
//! reservation, container start, event-log open or append, and run-directory
//! write goes through typed funnel APIs that take a typed site".
//!
//! # What a funnel is here
//!
//! `decisions.effect_site_inventory.identity`: "every effectful funnel API
//! takes its group's site by value, and the funnel itself calls
//! `hook(Before, site) -> primitive -> hook(After, site)`, so hooks exist for
//! every site by construction". [`funnel`] is that sentence, once, and every
//! primitive in this module goes through it. Production passes [`NoHooks`],
//! which answers [`Injection::Proceed`](crate::topology::effects::Injection::Proceed)
//! and records nothing; the ST-07 subset passes [`HarnessEffects`], which records
//! into PR3's [`HookHarness`](crate::topology::effects::HookHarness).
//!
//! The after hook is **not** called when the primitive returned `Err`. The
//! after phase's claim is `AfterEffect::Referenced` / `Unreferenced` /
//! `Released` — "the artifact is present and referenced by the row `row()`
//! names" — and a funnel that ran it after a failed primitive would record an
//! execution of a phase whose claim is false, which is the same false report
//! [`HookHarness`](crate::topology::effects::HookHarness) exists to prevent.
//!
//! # Nothing here is a production caller
//!
//! `slice_contract.non_goals[0]` is "production topology callers", and
//! `production_effect` is "none in behavior". These primitives are reached by
//! the suite and by gate evidence; the schema-4 coordinator that will call them
//! arrives in PR7–PR10. That is why this module adds no call site to
//! `src/engine/**` and changes no existing behaviour.
//!
//! # The reading trap of the packet, applied once here
//!
//! Every sentence quoted in this module comes from `decisions.*`, `invariants`,
//! or `transaction_fault_matrix`. `*_verification_dispositions`,
//! `finding_dispositions[].rationale` and the `v4_`..`v15_` keys are the
//! packet's disposition history and are quoted nowhere.
//!
//! # Allowlist placement
//!
//! `decisions.effect_site_inventory.mechanism` names this file first in the
//! **funnel section** of `effects/allowlist.toml`: "funnel modules
//! (src/workspace_manager.rs, …) each reviewed to perform effects only inside
//! site-taking APIs and never to return writable handles". Both halves of that
//! review are structural here: every effect is issued inside a [`funnel`] call
//! that takes an [`EffectSiteId`] by value, and no public function returns a
//! `File`, an `OpenOptions`, or a `Command` — the only handles that leave this
//! module are paths, object ids, and values.

///
/// **This is not `runner::container::racing_removal`, and the two must not be merged.**
/// That one resolves a *handoff*: two threads racing on one path, where the loser needs

/// `yield_now`s first, and sleeps `RACING_SLEEP` for the rest of `RACING_ACCESS_ATTEMPTS`

    ///    waited on. On Windows the coordinator's ambient kill-on-close job
    ///    ends its children with it (INV-18).
    /// 2. **The ref is the run's own.** The two integration sites write the
    ///    ref `run_started` recorded as the run's integration ref, which
    ///    `DESIGN.md` §26 treats as the run's: a head the log did not put
    ///    there is foreign integration state and is refused, never adopted.
    ///    Every other Ref site writes under the run's namespace,
    ///    `RUN_REF_ROOT/<run-id>/`, which nothing but this engine writes
    ///    (`refuse_unexpected_refs`), and a name offered to one of those sites
    ///    from outside it is left exactly as it was before this function
    ///    existed, Git refusing on it as before.
    /// 3. **The ref is not in `packed-refs`.** `git pack-refs --prune` is the
    ///    one Git command that takes another ref's lock: it packs, commits the
    ///    packed file, and only then locks each loose ref it deletes. A ref
    ///    absent from the packed file read *after* the lock was seen has no
    ///    prune over it; one present there may, and is refused
    ///    ([`Refusal::RefLockOnPackedRef`]).

    ///    writes the new object id into the lock before the rename and nothing
    ///    into a deletion's lock; a lock naming anything else belongs to
    ///    another write and is refused ([`Refusal::RefLockNamesAnotherWrite`]).

///   traces;
/// - a **streamed** loose write — an object above `core.bigFileThreshold`,
///   whose oid, and so whose fan-out, is unknown until the stream ends —
///   goes to the **object root**: `unpack-objects` with the threshold at 512
///   opened `objects/tmp_obj_KSwW4k` and linked it to `objects/88/fb3fef…`.
///   `unpack-objects` is the producer traced to the root; `index-pack --stdin`

///   `pack/tmp_pack_*`, `pack/tmp_idx_*` and `pack/tmp_rev_*`
///   (`33-r6-strace-index-pack-vs-unpack-objects.log`), so exceeding the
///   threshold does not by itself send a producer to the root, and fetch and
///   clone were not traced. The store is the one the engine shares with the
