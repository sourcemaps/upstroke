//! The second deletion-authority token, and it exists only in the test build.
//!
//! # Why there are two tokens rather than one
//!
//! `remove_private_husk` is reachable only with a `PrivateHalfProof`, which
//! is what `resource_accounting.completeness_rule` means by "a private-half
//! deletion outside the proof-token funnel fails to compile". That token is
//! about a **run's** private half: `prove_private_half_ownership` mints it
//! from a marker, a reciprocal owner record, and — conjunct 12, fail-closed —
//! the *proved* absence of `<private>/committed.json`.
//!
//! A test's scratch tree is not that. It is a directory the test created
//! moments earlier, holding fixtures the test itself wrote; no census reads it,
//! no run is bound to it, and reclaiming it is not a run-lifecycle effect.
//! Routing it through `PrivateHalfProof` would mean forging that token or
//! weakening conjunct 12 so that a fixture carrying a published
//! `committed.json` could be cleaned up — and a fixture that publishes one is
//! exactly the fixture the conjunct-12 tests need. Both are prohibited, and
//! both would trade a live production guarantee for test convenience.
//!
//! So run-directory deletion authority is token-carried with **exactly two
//! token classes**:
//!
//! | token | authorises | minted by | refuses |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `PrivateHalfProof` | one run's private half, on the run-lifecycle paths | `prove_private_half_ownership` | every shape a `RetainReason` names, `committed.json` included |
//! | `ScratchTreeOwnership` | one scratch tree, in the test build only | [`acquire`] | an occupied root, and an undecidable one |
//!
//! Neither can be forged, cloned, defaulted or spent twice, and neither can
//! name a path its own minting did not bind. That is the completeness rule in
//! its two-token form, and `decisions/2026-08-30-test-scratch-tree-ownership.md`
//! is the record.
//!
//! One recursive deletion under the **public** half is authorised by a record
//! the run wrote rather than by either token: the report writer's own staging
//! directory, `<public>/.report-staging-<ulid>`, which
//! `rundir::reclaim_report_staging` removes only when `<private>/report-staging.json`
//! — written by the run, in its private half, durably, before the directory
//! existed — names it (PR10's round 10). The record is the run's own writing
//! in the run's own tree, so what it names is the run's own tree *by the
//! record*, the way the private half is the run's by the token; a directory
//! of that shape that no record names is not the run's, is never removed and
//! never adopted, and is named in the writer's diagnostic instead.
//!
//! # Acquisition and the lifetime of the root
//!
//! [`acquire`] creates the root with a non-recursive `fs::create_dir` that
//! refuses an occupied name, then opens and retains the directory. The token
//! keeps that original handle across disarm, rearm and failed reclaim. A
//! checked use and every reclaim compare the pathname's current directory
//! with the retained handle, refusing an observed replacement. Reclaim also
//! requires an observation that the root is absent before reporting success.
//!
//! These checks establish identity at the observations. They do not make
//! mkdir-plus-open atomic, pin later pathname resolution, or protect children
//! from an active same-user writer. A replacement between a check and a later
//! filesystem call remains outside that observation. Changing the ULID seed
//! cannot close those intervals; no continuous isolation guarantee is made.
//!
//! The holder may publish a `committed.json` fixture inside the root. This
//! funnel therefore does not use that file as a deletion boundary; doing so
//! would prevent cleanup of the very fixture that tests the production rule.
//! Run-lifecycle deletion retains its separate proof requirement; see
//! `remove_private_husk`, the
//! `RunDir.PublishCommitRecord` site, and `engine::topology::create`.
//!
//! # Not a production effect
//!
//! There is no `RunDirSite` variant here, no row in `effect_sites.json`, and no
//! censused site. `effect_site_inventory` is the inventory of the **engine's**
//! effects and nothing here runs in a build of the engine: the module is
//! `#[cfg(test)]`, so it is absent from the rlib altogether. That absence is
//! also why the compile-fixture harness beside `PrivateHalfProof`
//! (`tests::build_refusals`, which compiles against this crate's rlib) cannot
//! reach this type, and why the refusals it carries are written the way
//! `NoSecondToken` describes.
// Allowlist placement: the **funnel section** of `effects/allowlist.toml`, by
// attachment to `src/rundir.rs`. The recursive deletion this module owns was
// reviewed into that file's row when the module was inline; it is out of line
// since W1 and carries a row and a level of its own.
//
// `PR6-LANEF-004`: a Rust lint level is scoped by the MODULE TREE and not by
// the file, so without an attribute here the parent's inner allow of all three
// would reach this file silently. `clippy::disallowed_macros` is RE-DENIED
// rather than inherited -- measured at zero sites, and deliberately so: the
// unwinding report path exists because `eprintln!` panics on a write error, so
// a print macro appearing in this file is a build error and not a style note.
// `decisions.effect_site_inventory.mechanism` (2).
