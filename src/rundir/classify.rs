//! Committed-or-Husk, or neither: the first-line probe `startup_census`
//! classifies by.
//!
//! `sequential_substrate.startup_census`: "every entry is classified by
//! `rundir::classify_run_dir` as **Committed** (`events.jsonl` exists and its
//! first newline-terminated line is a valid `run_started`) or **Husk**
//! (anything else)". Read-only, and bounded rather than total: the census
//! holds the physical worktree lock across it, so an entry that never
//! classifies is a lock held for ever, and every bound here exists for that.
//!
//! **A bound has to answer something, and that is why there is a third
//! classification** ([`RunDirClass::Indeterminate`], `SWEEP-CLASSIFY-001`). The
//! packet's two answers are what an observation that *finished* gives; an
//! interrupted read that ran out of [`INTERRUPTED_ALLOWANCE`] finished nothing,
//! and `Husk` — the answer a two-valued bound is forced into — is the
//! reclaiming one. Every bound in this file now answers the retaining one
//! instead. What that costs is stated on the variant: a directory retained and
//! hidden from `list_runs`, rather than a hang, and rather than a deletion.
//!
//! **What `startup_census` is, since this module cites it throughout.** It is a
//! sentence of the retired `sequential_substrate` packet. Neither `DESIGN.md`
//! nor any `design/` section states it at this SHA — measured, not assumed — so
//! every quotation of it in this file is the wording this module was built to
//! and this module's own reasoning for behaving that way, and none of it is
//! design authority. A citation below that reads as though the design required
//! something should be read as: this is what the module does, and this is why.
//! That the design carries no classification rule for a run directory is a gap
//! rather than a licence to invent one here; it is `SWEEP-CLASSIFY-013`, and
//! closing it is an owner-level design change rather than this pull request's.
//!
//! What is not bounded is named where it lives, and it is one syscall.
//! [`first_committed_line`] refuses to open anything whose *name* is not a
//! regular file, and the window between that check and the `open` is still
//! open, so a path swapped inside it for a writer-less fifo blocks in the
//! kernel before any bound on the read can apply.
//!
//! **Measured rather than restated, and then decided.** The block is real
//! (`SWEEP-CLASSIFY-003`, with the reproduction and its output in
//! `findings/`). The usual close on Unix — open with `O_NONBLOCK` and
//! take the file type from the descriptor — reaches a governed primitive:
//! `clippy.toml` denies `std::fs::File::options` and the `std::fs::OpenOptions`
//! it hands out, and `libc::open` and `libc::fcntl` beside them.
//!
//! **That is not a bar to writing it here, and an earlier version of this
//! paragraph wrongly said it was.** `standards/02` admits a per-site
//! `#[expect]` of a governed lint below module level in a file whose
//! `effects/allowlist.toml` row records the lint and the exact annotation
//! count, and `src/effects/tests.rs`'s placement census requires that file to
//! **deny** the lint at module level — so this module's deny posture is the
//! mechanism's precondition rather than the thing an allowance would replace.
//! The close is available locally, at the cost of an allowlist row.
//!
//! It is deferred anyway, as a **preference and not a constraint**: a governed
//! primitive belongs in the funnel parent as a site-taking non-blocking
//! read-only open, and the round that would have added it here is the round a
//! frontier pass found a P1 inside the machinery this file's previous round
//! added — which is the standing signal to narrow rather than to reach for one
//! more mechanism. `SWEEP-CLASSIFY-003` carries that reasoning and the
//! measurement it rests on.

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
// level is scoped by the module tree and not by the file, so an out-of-line
// child of `src/rundir.rs` would otherwise inherit that file's inner
// `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
// -- `PR6-LANEF-004`, measured twice in the Container subtree and made again,
// independently, by two W1 pull requests. Nothing here reaches a governed
// primitive, so all three are DENIED rather than allowed, and this module takes
// no `effects/allowlist.toml` row: an allowance is what that file records, and
// this module takes none.
//
// **Measured, not believed.** A probe of three lines -- a `std::fs::write`, a
// `std::process::Command` and a `println!` -- is refused three times here, once
// per lint, with this attribute cited as the level; the identical three lines in
// `src/rundir.rs` emit no `disallowed_*` at all, under that file's own allow. So
// the deny is load-bearing rather than a restatement of an ambient rule.

    // read, which every committed run past P7 is, since P7 is the step that
    // removes the marker.

    // a bare directory or one holding the staging file alone: an `events.jsonl`
    // this probe failed to read is an entry in that listing, so the answer is
    // `RetainReason::MarkerlessWithContent`. Both halves are pinned by
    // `proof_cases`' "marker-less husk carrying run-scoped content" and "bare

    // two different failures into `[]` — the reclaiming answer. It answers `[]`
    // when `read_dir` itself fails, and its `.flatten()` drops an entry whose

    // (`EMFILE`, `ENFILE`) reaches the `open` below, the marker read and that
    // listing at the same moment, and `remove_public_husk` lists the directory
    // again once it has passed. Neither fold is in this file; both are
