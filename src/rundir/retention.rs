// -- `PR6-LANEF-004`, measured twice in the Container subtree and made again,
// independently, by two W1 pull requests. Nothing here reaches a governed
// primitive, so all three are DENIED rather than allowed, and this module takes
// no `effects/allowlist.toml` row: an allowance is what that file records, and
// this module takes none.
//
// **Measured, not believed.** A probe of three lines -- a `std::fs::write`, a
// `std::process::Command` and a `println!` -- is refused three times here, once
// per lint, with this attribute cited as the level; the identical three lines in

// the deny is load-bearing rather than a restatement of an ambient rule.
