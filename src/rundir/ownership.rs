//! The proof and the token it mints, alone in a module.
//!
//! The token's fields are private to this module and this module contains
//! exactly one function that constructs one, so
//! [`prove_private_half_ownership`] is the only constructor of
//! [`PrivateHalfProof`] — not by convention but because no other code, inside
//! `rundir` or outside it, can name the fields. The type derives nothing: a
//! `Clone` would let a spent token authorise a second deletion and a `Default`
//! would mint one out of nothing, and both are exactly what
//! `resource_accounting.completeness_rule` means by "a private-half deletion
//! outside the proof-token funnel fails to compile".
//!
//! **The seal moved out of line unchanged.** Every item keeps the visibility it
//! had inside the inline `mod ownership { … }`: the two names the parent
//! re-exports are the two it re-exported before, `commit_record_proves_absence`
//! is still `pub(super)`, and the three helpers below it are still private. A
//! sibling module of `rundir` can no more name [`PrivateHalfProof`]'s fields
//! than it could yesterday.

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
// level is scoped by the module tree and not by the file, and this module is
// the crate's single deletion authority, so inheriting `src/rundir.rs`'s inner
// `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
// is exactly the shape `PR6-LANEF-004` is about. The proof is read-only --
// `fs::read_to_string`, `fs::symlink_metadata` and `fs::canonicalize`, none of
// them a governed primitive -- so all three are DENIED here and this module
// takes no `effects/allowlist.toml` row. The deletion the token authorises is
// `rundir::remove_private_husk`, in the parent, behind
// `RunDir.RemovePrivateHusk`, and it stays there.
//
// **Read-only is the whole of that argument, and it is not a claim of
// totality.** The reads are unbounded: `.creating` or `owner.json` swapped for
// a writer-less fifo blocks `read_to_string` in the kernel, and `husk_report`
// calls this proof under the physical worktree lock, so an entry that never
// proves is a lock held for ever. That code is byte-identical to the parent's
// and stays out of this split's scope; the assertion of totality over it does
// not, in either place it was made. `prove_private_half_ownership`'s own doc
// says the same thing where a reader of that function will see it, so the two
// cannot be read as disagreeing.
//
// **Measured, not believed.** A probe of three lines -- a `std::fs::write`, a
// `std::process::Command` and a `println!` -- is refused three times here, once
// per lint, with this attribute cited as the level; the identical three lines in
// `src/rundir.rs` emit no `disallowed_*` at all, under that file's own allow. So
// the deny is load-bearing rather than a restatement of an ambient rule.
