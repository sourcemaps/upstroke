//! The names one run's files carry on disk, as constants.
//!
//! The marker, the two private records and their staging siblings, the event
//! log and the frozen plan. They are consts rather than a literal at each call
//! site because the sites that have to agree on the byte string sit in
//! different files.
//!
//! **Who writes each, exactly.** Seven of the eight are published by a funnel
//! in `src/rundir.rs`: `stage_marker` and `publish_marker`, the owner and
//! commit-record pairs, and `write_plan` for [`PLAN`]. [`EVENT_LOG`] is the
//! exception and is worth knowing about — `src/rundir.rs` only *names* it, in
//! `RunPaths::events` and in the re-export; the log itself is opened and
//! appended by `EventLog` in `src/events/log.rs`, which takes the path it is
//! given. So this module names a file that `rundir` does not write.
//!
//! Reading them back: the classifier in `classify.rs` (`EVENT_LOG`), and the
//! ownership proof in `ownership.rs`, below. Pinning them:
//! `the_names_on_disk_are_the_names_the_packet_writes` in `tests.rs` binds
//! every const to its literal. A second test,
//! `the_event_log_and_plan_accessors_return_the_paths_their_constants_name`, fails on
//! an **accessor drift** — a `RunPaths` accessor spelling something other than
//! its const. It does not fail on a change to the const, which moves both sides
//! of its assertion, and it cannot witness the substitution that put accessor
//! and const in agreement at all; its own doc says why.
//!
//! **One source of truth for `rundir`, not yet for the crate.** [`EVENT_LOG`]
//! and [`PLAN`] name the two files a command outside this module opens by path
//! rather than through `RunPaths`, and **seven production sites in five files**
//! still spell the byte string for themselves: five of `events.jsonl`
//! (`export.rs`, `validate.rs`, `engine/resume.rs`, `status.rs`, `capacity.rs`)
//! and two of `plan.normalized.json` (`export.rs`, `engine/resume.rs`). One
//! derivation, quoted the same way here, in `SWEEP-NAMES-002` and in the pull
//! request body. A rename of either const is therefore still a multi-file edit.
//! The six names above them are not: no production code outside `rundir` spells
//! any of the six as a path. One test does — `engine/topology/emit/tests.rs`,
//! joining `committed.json` — and that one is load-bearing rather than untidy;
//! see below and `SWEEP-NAMES-003`.
//!
//! **What the proof consults, exactly.** `prove_private_half_ownership` reads
//! two of these back and parses each ([`MARKER`], then [`OWNER_RECORD`] at the
//! locator the marker names); *stats* a third, because conjunct 12 is
//! [`COMMIT_RECORD`]'s **existence** and never its content; and compares a lone
//! directory entry against [`MARKER_STAGED`] to tell a bare husk from a staged
//! one. Four names, three kinds of use — a reader replacing the stat with a
//! read would be weakening the deletion boundary, not tidying it.
//!
//! **What has product authority here, and what does not.** `DESIGN.md` §15's
//! run-directory drawing carries [`EVENT_LOG`] and [`PLAN`]. The other six
//! appear in no `design/` section at all, so this repository states no rule
//! about renaming them — and for these six a rename is not a refactor. A run
//! killed after old P5b still holds a file called `committed.json`; a proof
//! built on the new name would stat it, find it absent, mint a deletion token
//! on that absence and delete a private half that had crossed the deletion
//! boundary. The missing compatibility contract is `SWEEP-NAMES-008`, deferred:
//! it belongs in §15 and `DESIGN.md` is the owner's.
//!
//! One test stands between that and a green suite today, and it is not in this
//! module: `engine/topology/emit/tests.rs` joins `"committed.json"` by hand.
//! `SWEEP-NAMES-003` holds the measurement and states the count; it is not
//! repeated here, because a number restated in four places is a number that
//! drifts in three of them.
//!
//! Nothing in `src/` stands in for that, and nothing here tries to. A retired
//! decision record establishes no product contract, and neither does
//! implementation or test code quoting one, so no citation of
//! `decisions.workspace_candidates.run_creation` appears above. Until §15 says
//! otherwise, the six byte strings below are pinned by
//! `the_names_on_disk_are_the_names_the_packet_writes` and by nothing with
//! design standing.

// **This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
// level is scoped by the module tree and not by the file, so an out-of-line
// child of `src/rundir.rs` would otherwise inherit that file's inner
// `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
// -- `PR6-LANEF-004`, measured twice in the Container subtree and made again,
// independently, by two W1 pull requests. Nothing here reaches a governed
// primitive, so all three are DENIED rather than allowed, and this module takes
// no `effects/allowlist.toml` row: an allowance is what that file records, and
// this module takes none.
//
// **Measured, not believed.** A probe of three lines -- a `std::fs::write`, a
// `std::process::Command` and a `println!` -- is refused three times here, once
// per lint, with this attribute cited as the level; the identical three lines in
// `src/rundir.rs` emit no `disallowed_*` at all, under that file's own allow. So
// the deny is load-bearing rather than a restatement of an ambient rule.
