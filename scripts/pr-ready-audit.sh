# pr-ready-audit.sh: decide, per open pull request, whether it is ready to enqueue for merge
# under the lane policy of scripts/lane.sh, and optionally maintain the lane and ready labels.
#
#   scripts/pr-ready-audit.sh [--apply] [--enqueue] [--ready-label NAME] [--reviewer LOGIN] [PR ...]
#
# NAME must not be a lane:* label. The ready label is advisory: it reports that this audit found
# the head it read READY. A GitHub label is not bound to a commit, so the head is read again
# before the label is written and again after, and a label written across a push is removed
# (HEAD-MOVED); that narrows the race, it cannot close it. The act bound to the audited head is
# the enqueue, through `gh pr merge --match-head-commit`, and the base is read again just before
# it (BASE-MOVED); nothing may treat the label alone as permission to merge.
#
# --apply maintains the lane:* and ready label on each pull request. --enqueue adds every READY
# pull request to the merge queue (`gh pr merge --merge --auto`) in the order the arguments give,
# so the caller states the priority; with no arguments it walks the open pull requests in the
# API's order, which is not a priority. It implies --apply.
#
# --ready-label NAME uses an existing label of that name as it is (the audit adds and removes it
# on pull requests and never recolours or redescribes it) and creates it only when absent.
#
# --reviewer LOGIN, or UPSTROKE_REVIEW_AUTHOR, names the account whose review comments this audit
# trusts. Whose word counts is a trust decision, so it is stated, not deduced. When neither is
# given the repository's own owner is used, which is right only while the repository belongs to
# the person who reviews it: on 2026-09-06 `upstroke` moved into the `sourcemaps` organization,
# that field began resolving to the organization, no comment on earth is authored by an
# organization, and every pull request silently audited as `no-review` -- READY became
# unreachable and --enqueue enqueued nothing. It failed closed, and it failed invisibly, which is
# why an organization owner is now refused outright rather than carried into the query.
#
# LOGIN must be shaped like a GitHub account name -- 1 to 39 ASCII letters and digits with single
# hyphens between them -- and anything else is refused, never tried: an account that cannot exist
# reads as `no-review` on every pull request, which is the silence this flag exists to end. The
# value reaches the comment query as string data and is never part of the query's text, so a
# string shaped like a query is compared as a login and matches nothing. Spelling is compared
# without regard to case, as GitHub compares it: `EventLoops` and `eventloops` are one account.
# A bot login of the form `name[bot]` is not a GitHub account name and is refused; no such account
# posts reviews here today, and admitting one is a change to whom this audit trusts, not a widened
# pattern. The character set is spelled out rather than written as a range, because a range in a
# bash regex is resolved by the locale's collation and not by ASCII: under en_US.utf8 `[A-Za-z]`
# admits `é` and the Kelvin sign, so a check whose comment promised ASCII passed `evéntloops`
# through to the API as a login nobody has.
#
# Which source supplies LOGIN is settled before the value is checked, and only the value this run
# will trust is checked: the flag replaces the environment variable rather than being read after
# it, so an inherited UPSTROKE_REVIEW_AUTHOR this run does not use cannot refuse the run that
# overrode it. Neither --reviewer nor --ready-label will take the next option as its value: an
# argument beginning with a hyphen is refused, never consumed. The test is the hyphen and not a
# list of today's options, because a guard written as that list drifted from the options there
# are and let `-h` through; consuming an option both misnames the value and silently switches
# off the flag it swallowed.
#
# Lanes, decided by the branch prefix and nothing else, from ONE TABLE: scripts/lane.sh, sourced
# below and also sourced by the box's review-poller.sh and make-fix-brief.sh. It held three copies
# before, each reading `codex/findings-p3-*`, `codex/findings-*` and a catch-all, and the branch
# vocabulary has thirteen prefixes and none of them is `codex/` -- so every real branch fell into
# the catch-all, which is the loosest fix set, and nothing said so. Eleven lanes, eleven `lane:*`
# labels, and the label list and both reconciliation loops below are driven from `lane_list` so
# they cannot drift from the table again.
#
# A lane:* label is an OUTPUT and never an input; a wrong one is corrected by --apply and reported
# as lane-label-mismatch. A BRANCH OUTSIDE THE VOCABULARY HAS NO LANE: `lane_for` refuses it, and
# the pull request carrying it is reported NOT-READY with `branch-prefix-unknown`. It is not given
# a default lane, and it does not stop the run -- the other pull requests are still audited.
#
# The P3 rule (owner, 2026-09-08) replaces `verdict-not-pass`, which is gone: a P3 lane is ready
# when its review carries no P0, P1 or P2 and three P3s or fewer. A P3 carrying a witness is fixed
# whatever the count -- that is the `witnessed:` blocker below, which fires in every lane -- so the
# tolerance is three UNWITNESSED P3s, and a fourth blocks as `unwitnessed-p3s`. Nothing loops
# reviews to reach a PASS any more.
#
# A pull request is READY when all of these hold on its current head and base:
#   - not a draft; GitHub reports it mergeable: DIRTY, UNKNOWN and BLOCKED fail closed, and
#     BEHIND fails closed while the default-branch ruleset requires an up-to-date branch (the
#     ruleset is read; once the merge queue replaces that requirement, BEHIND is what the queue
#     exists to handle and no longer blocks)
#   - the newest `upstroke-ci` and `upstroke-pr-policy` check runs on the head succeeded
#   - the latest review comment by the trusted reviewer above (the `Reviewed head:` workflow form
#     with its fenced JSON verdict, or the `<!-- upstroke-frontier-review -->` prose form) reviewed
#     the head itself, or a commit the head differs from only by clean merge commits (git's own
#     merge of the two parents, the branch diff byte-identical before and after, and no gate
#     edited by the pull request) and pushes confined to findings/ or reviews/FINDINGS.md
#     (MAINTAINING step 5 keeps the review across both)
#   - the review is against the pull request's own base: the workflow form must record its base
#     commit, which must lie on the current base branch (and, for a base other than master, not
#     on master); no base change may be recorded on the pull request after the review was
#     posted, which is checked again just before an enqueue; the prose form records no base, so
#     it is bound to the base only by that timeline check and counts only on a master-based
#     pull request
#   - no finding in that review has a severity the lane must fix
#   - every allowed finding has a ledger row in the body whose disposition is deferred, with
#     exactly one file under findings/ on the branch whose YAML frontmatter (the block
#     between the opening --- and the next) carries `id: <the finding id>`; a rejected or
#     accepted-risk row is the owner's call and sends the pull request to MANUAL
#
# This script decides whether to merge, so every uncertainty resolves to NOT-READY. A read that
# failed, a read that may be short, and a field the review did not record are each an uncertainty,
# and none of them is an empty result: an unreadable comment page blocks as `review-lookup-failed`,
# a review comment the audit could not fetch as `review-fetch-failed`, a parser that exited
# non-zero as `review-parse-failed`, a parser result that did not arrive whole as
# `review-parse-incomplete`, an unreadable timeline as `timeline-lookup-failed`, an unreadable
# pull request as `pr-lookup-failed`, an unreadable pull-request body as `ledger-lookup-failed`
# and one the parser refused or that did not arrive whole as `ledger-parse-failed` and
# `ledger-parse-incomplete`, a review that records no reviewed commit as
# `review-records-no-reviewed-sha`, a finding-file listing that errored as
# `finding-file-lookup-failed`, and a gate-edit check that could not run as
# `gate-edit-check-failed`; an unreadable ruleset list or open-pull-request list refuses the whole
# run before the first pull request is judged. Every list request is paginated, because a first
# page is not a list and 30 rows of nothing hid an active ruleset on page two.
#
# A HELPER'S ANSWER IS A WRITE, and the value that comes back is checked against the answers there
# are rather than against the one that blocks. `base_changed_after` said `yes` through an `echo`
# whose status `return 0` discarded, so a failed write left the caller an empty string and
# `[[ "$retargeted" == yes ]]` read it as "the base did not change": exit 0, and a pull request
# retargeted since its review enqueued. Every one of these channels now names its permissive
# answer explicitly and blocks on everything else -- `timeline-answer-unreadable` for a retarget
# answer that is neither `yes` nor `no`, `review-id-unreadable` for a comment id that is not a
# number, a refusal for a ruleset state that is not two flags, and a refusal from `must_fix_for`
# for a lane it does not know (an empty must-fix set makes every severity deferrable). The
# permissive answer has to be SAID; it is never the one everything else falls into.
#
# Reading "I could not look" as "there is nothing there" is precisely how a blocked pull request
# enqueues, and it has happened here more than once: a comment page whose failure was swallowed
# dropped the newest review and let an older PASS win; an unpaginated ruleset list dropped the
# BEHIND blocker; an empty `--reviewer` moved trust to the repository's owner. Each was one line,
# and each called merge.
#
# THE REVIEW IS NOT PARSED IN BASH, and that is this file's answer to the same rule rather than
# another armoured site. Seven consecutive rounds of frontier review found the same defect seven
# times in this path, each time in a shape nobody had armoured yet -- `|| true`, `pipefail`'s
# rightmost status, a here-string that could not spill, a redirection that failed before its
# command ran, `read`'s end-of-input-that-is-also-error, `grep`'s 1-that-is-an-answer, and finally
# an unchecked `printf` whose `write()` returned EIO while the function around it returned 0, so
# one finding vanished from a findings list that still announced itself complete. In bash, failure
# is representable as success: a status that must be remembered, a stream with no end-to-end
# integrity, `errexit` suspended inside `||`. So both review forms, format detection included, are
# read by `scripts/pr-review-parse.py`, which either writes the whole result and exits 0 or writes
# nothing and exits non-zero, and confirms its own write before deciding which. The contract on
# this side is the whole of it: RUN IT; IF ITS EXIT STATUS IS NOT 0, BLOCK; OTHERWISE READ ITS
# RESULT FROM THE FILE IT WROTE. Nothing here re-derives, re-scans or repairs what it emitted.
# There is no in-band completeness marker to forge: the payload declares its own record count,
# which the parser computed, and a payload that did not arrive whole fails that count.
#
# The same rule reaches down to how data is handed to a command. `<<<` spills to a temporary file
# once it outgrows a pipe buffer, and a temporary file bash cannot create is a redirection that
# failed: the command never runs and the shell returns 1. That 1 is `grep`'s "no match", so the
# two are one answer; for a compound command (`while ... done <<< "$x"`) the body is simply
# skipped, which neither a captured status nor `set -e` can see; and for `read` or `mapfile` the
# variables it was to fill are left holding whatever they held before. So THIS FILE CONTAINS NO
# HERE-STRING AND NO HERE-DOCUMENT AT ALL, which is a shape a gate can hold whole rather than one
# instance at a time: lines are walked by expansion, a fixed program text is written with
# `printf`, and a read that needs a file gets a real one whose write is checked.
#
# Other states: NEEDS-ATTEST (the head moved past the reviewed commit by more than clean merges
# and ledger pushes: a repair-only push the owner reads and attests under step 5, a merge commit
# that is not git's own merge of its parents, or a new change that needs another pass), MANUAL
# (the review is prose the audit cannot judge: findings without ids, or a severity token outside
# the numbered findings, so a person reads it), and NOT-READY with the blockers listed. MANUAL is
# decided from the blocker array itself, by expansion, with no command in the condition: written
# as `printf ... | grep -q '^manual:'` it was a failure representable as success one last time --
# `grep` exiting 2 left `state=READY` with the blocker still in the row, and the audit printed
# READY, listed the manual blocker beside it and called merge.
#
# Exactly one account's review comments count, and anyone else's comment carrying the markers is
# ignored, so a contributor cannot mint a PASS. Which account that is comes from the caller --
# --reviewer or UPSTROKE_REVIEW_AUTHOR -- and only when neither is given does a User owner stand
# in. The override moves that trust; it never widens it, and there is no value of it that admits
# a second author. MAINTAINING names the trusted writer, and pointing this audit at anyone else
# is a decision the caller states on the command line, where it is visible.
#
# Limits, stated so nobody reads more into READY than it says: the audit sees severities and the
# fields the review JSON carries. A finding whose object carries a witness, reproduction, repro,
# failing_test or mutation field that is not null, false or empty blocks in every lane, and so
# does one whose fields name a MUST deviation (a field named mandatory/deviation/must_*, or the
# word MUST in any string field); a witness or deviation that exists only in prose does not
# reach the audit, and the deferring implementor's row asserts there is none (MAINTAINING step 5
# binds them). A merge-in is checked on step 5's terms: git's own merge of its parents, the
# branch diff byte-identical before and after, no gate edited by the pull request, and no branch
# commit outside the ledger.
#
# The pure parts (the lane table, the parser call and the reader for its result, the frontmatter id
# match, the newest-check-run choice) are functions, exercised by
# .github/scripts/test-pr-ready-audit.sh along with `scripts/pr-review-parse.py` itself; sourcing
# this file with PR_READY_AUDIT_LIBRARY=1 defines them, and `scripts/lane.sh`'s with them, without
# running the audit.
#
# Needs: bash, git (a checkout with `origin` pointing at the repository), gh (its built-in --jq
# does the API-side JSON work), and python3 or python, which now reads BOTH review forms and the
# pull request's ledger; without a python nothing is judged and every pull request blocks.

# THE P3 RULE'S TOLERANCE (owner, 2026-09-08). A P3 lane is ready when its review carries no P0, P1

# fixed whatever the count -- that is the `witnessed:` blocker below, and it fires in every lane and

# finding_file_count ID TREEISH: how many files under the finding ledger in TREEISH carry `id: ID`
# in their YAML frontmatter. A non-zero status means the listing, or one of the files it named,
# could not be read -- which is not a count of zero. This rule wants exactly one file, so a read
# that quietly does not count can turn two files into one as easily as one into none.
#
# The candidates are the tree's own paths, from `git ls-tree`, and every one of them is read.
# `git grep` cannot supply them: it answers with the files it managed to search, and a blob it
# could not read is not among them -- with one file's blob removed it printed `unable to read` on
# stderr, exited 0, and returned the other name, so two files filing one id came back as one.
# Checking its status could not have caught that, because its status was 0. `ls-tree` reads the
# tree and not the blobs, so a file whose blob is gone is still a candidate here and fails its own
# read below. (No `*.md` pathspec: `ls-tree` matches paths literally and a glob selected nothing.)
#
# THE MODE GIT RECORDS DECIDES WHAT AN ENTRY IS, so the listing keeps it: `--name-only` drops it,
# and a name is not a file. A committed symlink is a `120000` blob whose CONTENT IS ITS TARGET
# STRING, and `git show` hands that string over exactly as it hands over a file's text -- so
# `findings/symlink.md`, a broken link whose target reads `---\nid: X\n---`, was counted
# as the file filing X and a finding that had never been written was filed. A `160000` gitlink is
# not a finding either. Only `100644` and `100755` are, which is the rule PR #251 settled for
# `validate-pr-branch.sh` against the same defect, from the same source: what git records, never
# what a checkout materialised or what a name suggests.
#
# Each file then gets exactly one of three answers: it carries the id, it does not, or it could
# not be read. `frontmatter_has_id` PRINTS the first two and keeps its status for the third, so
# that a blob bash could not open for it -- a redirection that fails returns 1 without running
# the command -- cannot answer in its place. Anything but a printed `0` or `1`, status included,
# refuses the count rather than being folded into "no".
#
# A LIST THAT ENDED IS NOT A LIST THAT WAS READ, which is the same rule one level up. `read`
# returns non-zero at end of input AND on a failed read, the loop below ends on either, and what
# it prints then is a count of the entries that happened to arrive: with the listing written
# whole and its read failing after the first record, two files filing one id counted as one, and
# that is `duplicate-file` turning into READY. `git ls-tree`'s status cannot see it -- it says
# the list was WRITTEN. So the listing is given a last record of this function's own and the
# count is printed only when the loop reached it; short of that, the read did not finish. That
# also covers the listing bash could not open for the loop, which is zero iterations and a count
# of zero.
#
# The names arrive NUL-separated through a file rather than a command substitution: `$(...)` drops
# NUL bytes, so the separators would vanish and the loop would read nothing at all -- a count of
# zero for every finding, on a tree that holds the file. The gate builds a small repository and
# counts in it, because that is the mistake a shape rule does not catch.

# reviewer_login STATE OVERRIDE OWNER_LOGIN OWNER_TYPE: the account whose reviews count, or
# nothing and a non-zero status when it cannot be settled. STATE is the word `given` or `absent`
# and nothing else. Otherwise the repository's owner stands in, but only when that owner is a
# User: an Organization owns no voice and cannot have written a review, so inheriting it produces
# a filter that matches nothing. Refusing here turns a fleet-wide silent `no-review` into one loud
# message at startup. Whichever side supplies it, the answer must be a login: this is the last
# gate before the value becomes the audit's notion of who may say PASS, and it holds even where
# main checked first.
#
# STATE exists because an empty override is not an absent one and only the caller knows which it
# is. This used to fall back to the owner whenever the override was empty, so `--reviewer ""` --
# an unset shell variable expanded into the flag -- silently moved trust to the repository's owner:
# on a User-owned repository whose owner had posted PASS and whose named reviewer had posted a
# newer block, adding that one empty flag turned NOT-READY into READY and called merge. A supplied
# value is validated whatever it holds; the owner stands in only when nothing was supplied at all.

# review_comment_filter: the jq program latest_review_id runs, held here rather than inline so the
# gate can run the exact text the audit runs. The login is not in that text: it arrives as string
# data in UPSTROKE_AUDIT_REVIEWER, which the call sets and so always overrides whatever the
# environment held (`gh api --jq` takes no --arg, and env is its way to pass a value in). A string
# shaped like jq is therefore compared as a login and matches nothing, rather than becoming part
# of the predicate. Both sides are lowered first because GitHub resolves `EventLoops` and
# `eventloops` to one account and an audit that split them would report the correct reviewer's
# blocking review as `no-review`. An unset variable is an error here, not an empty match: this
# audit's failures must be loud, and a filter that quietly matches nobody is the defect it exists
# to prevent.
#
# The two type guards come first and they are not defensive decoration. GitHub's REST schema lets
# an issue comment's `user` be null -- a deleted account -- and `ascii_downcase` raises on null,
# which fails the whole page, not the one comment: `--paginate` runs this program once per page,
# so one unrelated comment by a deleted account removed every review on its page from the
# comparison and let an older PASS win. A comment whose author or body is not a string is not
# this reviewer's review; it is dropped, and the fetch's own status is what reports failure.
#
# Written with `printf` and not a here-document, for the reason nothing in this file is fed by a
# here-string: bash writes a here-document to a temporary file once it outgrows a pipe buffer, and
