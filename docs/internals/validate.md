# `src/validate.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/validate.rs`](../../src/validate.rs).

These notes preserve the module comments after the annotation repairs. Item headings quote source lines for navigation.

## Module

`upstroke validate`: parse → config → graph checks → routing preview →
rendered report. No execution of anything.
LEGACY-EFFECT: this module is in the **frozen legacy section** of
`effects/allowlist.toml`, which carries its justification and the condition
under which the section shrinks. `decisions.effect_site_inventory.mechanism` (2).

## `pub config_path: Option<PathBuf>,`

Explicit `--config` path; `None` looks for `upstroke.toml` in
`config_root`.

## `pub config_root: PathBuf,`

Root of the repo the plan targets: config discovery and gate
derivation both resolve here, never against the process CWD.

## `pub pools_path: Option<PathBuf>,`

Pools file override for tests; `None` discovers `~/.upstroke/pools.toml`.

## `pub engine_limits: config::EngineLimits,`

Which reading of `[engine]`'s ceilings applies (see
[`config::EngineLimits`]). `Fresh` for `upstroke validate` and for a run
about to be created; a resume passes the reading its own recorded schema
selects.

Carried here rather than decided inside `analyze` because only the
caller knows which it is, and the difference is a refusal.

## `pub review: String,`

Who reviews, and where a second opinion applies (§11.2–§11.3).

## `pub effort: String,`

Effective reasoning policy before any process is spawned.

## `#[derive(Debug)]`

The shared front half of `validate` and the engine's pre-flight (§14:
"plan parses cycle-free"): parse, load config, check the graph, resolve
every routing chain. Executes nothing.

## `pub chains: Vec<ResolvedChain>,`

One resolved chain per task, aligned with `plan.tasks`.

## `pub gates: Vec<ShellGate>,`

Effective gates: `[[gates]]` verbatim, else derived from the repo's
shape (§17) — the single derivation point for validate and the engine.

## `#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]`

Every file an [`Analysis`] is derived from, captured at one instant.

The set has to be *complete* to be worth anything. A capture that covers the
config but not the plan, or the plan but not the files the gate derivation
reads, licenses exactly the confusion it was introduced to rule out: a caller
compares equal captures, concludes nothing moved, and adopts an analysis that
depended on something outside the comparison. So this names all of them, and
[`analyze_captured`] parses out of it rather than beside it.

## `gate_inputs: Vec<config::FileSnapshot>,`

The worktree files the gate derivation looks at when `[[gates]]` does not
spell the gates out: `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, and `package.json` beside
the repo root, which are what [`crate::gates::derive`] consults and the
whole of what it consults. Captured here so that a change to one of them
is a change to this analysis's inputs and not an unobserved edit —
keep this list in step with `gates::derive` itself.

## `const GATE_DERIVATION_INPUTS: &[&str] = &["Cargo.toml", "go.mod", "package.json"];`

The gate derivation's inputs, relative to the repo root — see
[`CapturedInputs::gate_inputs`].

## `#[must_use]`

Capture what an [`analyze`] with these options reads.

## `pub fn paths(&self) -> Vec<PathBuf> {`

Every captured file, in a stable order, for a caller that has to name
them in a message.

## `pub fn analyze(opts: &ValidateOptions) -> Result<Analysis, UpstrokeError> {`

Capture validation inputs and resolve the plan, configuration and task chains.

# Errors
Returns the contextual input, configuration, graph or adapter refusal from
[`analyze_captured`], including any warnings gathered before it failed.

## `pub fn analyze_captured(`

[`analyze`], out of bytes that were captured earlier.

The plan, the repo config and the pools file are parsed from `captured` and
from nowhere else, so the analysis this returns is bound to those exact
bytes: a caller holding the same `CapturedInputs` can prove what was
validated by comparing it against the filesystem, and a file that changed and
changed back cannot slip between the check and the answer, because there is
only one read.

The one input still read from the filesystem here is the gate derivation's:
[`crate::gates::derive`] takes a directory, and the three files it looks at
are captured but not consumed. A caller that needs the derivation pinned runs
this where the worktree cannot move — see the engine's pre-flight, which
takes its answer under the worktree lease.

# Errors
Returns the captured input's read or parse error, a configuration refusal,
an invalid task graph, or an unsupported pinned adapter. Warnings gathered
before a refusal accompany its original category in
[`UpstrokeError::WithWarnings`]; failures without warnings keep that category.

## `let raw = captured.plan.text()?.ok_or_else(|| UpstrokeError::Io {`

Named off the capture rather than off `opts`, so an error cannot report a
path other than the one that was actually read.

## `Some(configured) => configured`

Analysis retains the config and a separately owned executable
gate list, so the names and commands are copied into that snapshot.

## `pub fn builtin_adapter(agent: &str) -> bool {`

Whether this build ships an adapter for `agent`.

Injected into the checks below rather than called from them, so the guards
can be tested against agents that do and do not exist without waiting for
the registry to grow one.

## `fn check_pin_adapters(`

A pin naming an agent with no adapter must fail the same way in `validate`
and `run`; otherwise the preview promises a binding the run then refuses at
pre-flight (§18).

Currently unreachable through `upstroke.toml` alone — `config::load` rejects
any pin whose (agent, model) is absent from the catalog, and every catalog
agent has an adapter as of step 9. It stays because that is a coincidence of
today's table, not a property: §13 says the catalog ships ahead of support
(Aider models are catalogued in v0.2 before its adapter lands), and the
moment it does, this is what stops a preview from promising them.

## `pub fn run(opts: &ValidateOptions) -> Result<Report, UpstrokeError> {`

Build a zero-spend validation preview, including routing, gates and reviews.

# Errors
Returns an input, configuration, graph or adapter refusal from [`analyze`],
or a refusal to construct the requested review plan. Warnings gathered
before failure accompany the original typed error; successful previews
return them in [`Report::warnings`].

## `gates::preview_resolution(&analysis.gates, &opts.config_root, &mut warnings);`

Zero-spend preview of the §14 gate pre-flight: warn, never refuse.

## `let reviews = match review::plan_for(`

Who would judge the work (§11.2–§11.3), against the adapters this binary
ships. A run asks the same question of the adapters its own harness
holds, which in production is the same set — so the preview cannot
promise a reviewer the run would then refuse.

## `fn latest_run_observations(`

§13's observations, without executing anything: fold the latest run in this
repository, if there is one.

A missing or unreadable run is not an error here. `validate` describes a
plan; a broken run directory beside it is somebody else's problem, and
refusing to preview a plan over one would be a strange trade.
`has_pools` short-circuits the whole fold. With no pools connected the
capacity block is one line and the observations are never consulted, so
parsing an entire run's log for it is work with no reader — and `validate`
is the fast, zero-spend iteration loop §18 puts on day one.

## `Err(error) => {`

A run that exists but cannot be folded is not "no run" — and
`read_all`'s refusal ("the log has been rewritten…") is exactly the
loud error the event-log design exists to produce, so swallowing it
and reporting an empty repository hid two things at once.

## `pub fn render(&self) -> String {`

The rendered preview.

The surface stays here — it is the one every caller names, and the one
`effects/wrappers.toml` classifies under this module — while the table
it produces is `render::report`.

## `struct ForeignRoot(PathBuf);`

One test — [`a_scratch_root_is_distinct_per_call_and_leaves_a_strangers_directory_alone`]
— has to stand a directory at a name it chooses rather than at one
`scratch_tree::acquire` chose, because the name it needs is the exact name
the old helper computed. `acquire` cannot produce that name by construction,
which is the whole point of it, so this is the one guard in this region that
reclaims a caller-chosen path. Everything else here goes through
[`scratch_root`].

A caller-chosen path is also the whole of the hazard, which is why the only
way to obtain this type is the fallible constructor below.

## `fn acquire(root: &Path) -> io::Result<Self> {`

**Claim the directory first; arm the destructor second.** `fs::create_dir`
runs before `Self` exists, and the `?` is what holds that order: a refused
acquisition constructs no `ForeignRoot`, so there is nothing to drop and
nothing is deleted. Reversing the two lines is not a smaller version of the
same bug, it is a different one — a destructor armed on a path the fixture
never obtained — so the ordering is the fix and the call is secondary.

The first shape of this fixture had both halves wrong, and the consequence
was the very defect this region was repaired to remove:

- the guard was built from the path *before* the directory was made, so a
  recursive delete was armed over a path the fixture had not obtained; and
- the directory was made with `create_dir_all`, which succeeds on a name
  that is already a directory and creates missing parents besides.

Two review lenses reproduced it independently at `bc251106`, by different
routes, and both reproductions are in pull request #278's body as
`PR278-STANDIN-GUARD-ARMED-BEFORE-ACQUISITION`:

- **A directory occupant.** Stop the process before its first `ulid()` call,
  compute 5,000 candidate names from its pid, nonce 0 and a five-second
  millisecond window, plant a foreign file in each, resume. The run exited
  **0** having deleted one of them.
- **A symlink occupant.** Plant a symlink at the same name, pointing at a
  directory holding a file called `foreign-sentinel`. `create_dir_all`
  accepted it — `is_dir` follows a link — and the fixture then wrote through
  the link: the target's file was **overwritten**, again at exit **0**.
  Writing through an occupant's link is worse than deleting a directory the
  fixture did not own, because the target is chosen by whoever planted the
  link and need not be anywhere near `TMPDIR`.

`fs::create_dir` closes both, and it closes the symlink one *without*
following the link. It is `mkdir(2)`, which fails with `EEXIST` when the
final component already exists — including when that component is a symbolic
link, dangling or not, and without resolving it. So this is not a
stat-then-act check with a window between the look and the leap: there is no
look, and the refusal is the same call that would have created the
directory. `create_dir` is also non-recursive, so a missing `TMPDIR` is
refused and named rather than silently created and left behind.

[`a_stand_in_root_is_acquired_exclusively_and_a_refusal_deletes_nothing`]
witnesses the ordering, the occupied directory, both symlink shapes and the
missing parent. Its symlink half is `#[cfg(unix)]` and was measured on
Linux; this note makes no claim about how Windows resolves a reparse point
in `CreateDirectoryW`. The occupied-directory and missing-parent halves are
not conditional and are what the Windows leg runs.

## `impl Drop for ForeignRoot {`

Reclaimed on the unwinding path as well as the returning one, so a failing
assertion does not leave the very shape this region was repaired to stop
leaving. The reclaim result is reported rather than discarded; the
`thread::panicking()` arm is the one exception, because a second panic
during unwinding aborts the process and replaces the failing assertion's
report with nothing. `ScratchTree`'s own `Drop` makes the same trade for the
same reason.

## `struct Fixture {`

[`ValidateOptions`] bound to the scratch tree it names, so the directory
outlives every read of the options and goes when the test does. It derefs to
the options, so a call site reads and writes them directly and the fixture's
only other job is to stay alive.

This is why [`opts`] returns a `Fixture` and not a bare `ValidateOptions`:
`config_root` and `pools_path` are paths into a directory somebody has to
own, and a struct of bare paths gives no one that job.

## `fs::write(&pools, "# no pools\n").expect("empty pools file");`

A real, empty pools file: an explicit `--pools` that does not exist is a hard
error, and `None` would reach for the operator's own `~/.upstroke/pools.toml`.

One per fixture, inside that fixture's own scratch tree. It was one per
process behind a `OnceLock`, on the reasoning that a single shared path
cannot be truncated under a reader by a parallel test — true of the
rewriting this region does, and it bought that with a path no guard could
reclaim, because a `static` is never dropped. A fresh tree per call answers
both: there is no sharing to race and no residue to sweep.

## `fn scratch_root(tag: &str) -> ScratchTree {`

A scratch repo root of its own, so a test that rewrites its inputs cannot be
read half-written by another running beside it.

**Through the crate's own helper, and not a ninth hand-rolled one.**
[`crate::rundir::scratch_tree::acquire`] names the root with a fresh ULID and
takes it with a single exclusive `create_dir`, so an occupied name is refused
rather than adopted, and the `ScratchTree` it returns reclaims the tree when
it drops — on the unwinding path too. That module argues all of this at
length and tests it; what this file adds is a call to it.

Each of the three properties matters here for a reason this region learned
the hard way:

*Unique, and that is a different word from unguessable.* Every root in this
region used to be
`env::temp_dir().join(format!("upstroke-validate-<tag>-{}", process::id()))`.
A pid is not a unique key — it repeats across containers and after
wraparound, and one host here runs several suites at once. The same class of
bug is recorded for the fixed container pre-clean key in
`src/runner/container/fake.rs`. A ULID fixes *that*: two processes, or two
calls in one process, do not land on one name by accident.

It does not make the name a secret, and nothing in this region may be
written as though it does. `crate::ulid` digests a millisecond, a process id
and a per-process counter that starts at zero — three inputs a reader can
know — and `docs/internals/ulid.md` says so at its module section: "These
deterministic names are not secrets or proof of ownership. Filesystem
callers must reserve new roots exclusively."
`design/15_design_event_log_resume_run_layout.md` is the design authority and
says it of the id itself: "It does not promise unpredictable or
collision-free names; exclusive allocation supplies the fresh-run ownership
check." Anyone who can read this process's pid can compute every name it is
about to use; a review lens did exactly that, planted the next one, and
watched [`scratch_root`] refuse it as `Occupied` at exit 101. **That refusal
is the guarantee, not the arithmetic of the name.**

*Claimed.* `create_dir` refuses a name that exists where `create_dir_all`
adopts it. Nothing here adopts a directory, so nothing here has any reason to
pre-clean one — and the `let _ = fs::remove_dir_all(&dir);` that used to open
this helper, deleting whatever a previous run or another process had left at
a predictable path and discarding the error, is gone.

So the two properties this region actually rests on are **uniqueness**, which
keeps honest collisions from happening, and **exclusive acquisition**, which
decides what happens when one does anyway. Secrecy is not among them and
never was.

*Reclaimed.* `standards/12_standards_tests.md` asks for the first and the
third in as many words: "unique temporary directories with RAII cleanup".

`tag` survives only for a human reading a leftover tree.

## `fn opts_in(root: &Path, plan: &str) -> Fixture {`

[`opts`], rooted in `root` rather than in its own hermetic directory. The
fixture still owns — and still reclaims — the pools file it wrote, which
`root` does not contain.

## `fn a_stand_in_root_is_acquired_exclusively_and_a_refusal_deletes_nothing() {`

The trap in the remedy, made executable. Changing `create_dir_all` to
`create_dir` and stopping there leaves the destructor armed on the failing
path, which is a different bug rather than a smaller one, and no assertion
about the happy path can see it. So this test never reaches a successful
acquisition at all: every arm refuses, and then asserts that the refusal
took nothing with it.

Four refusals, each with its own mutation witness in pull request #278's
body:

- an **occupied directory** holding another holder's file — refused
  `AlreadyExists`, and the file is still there afterwards, which is what
  fails if the guard is built before the directory;
- a **symlink to a directory** whose target holds a `foreign-sentinel` —
  refused, the target's bytes unchanged, the link still a link;
- a **dangling symlink** — refused too, *and its target still does not
  exist*, which is how the test distinguishes refusing the link from
  resolving it and acting on the other end;
- a **missing parent** — refused `NotFound`, and the parent is not created.

The two symlink arms are `#[cfg(unix)]`. The other two are not, so the
Windows leg runs them.

## `fn a_scratch_root_is_distinct_per_call_and_leaves_a_strangers_directory_alone() {`

The measured harm, inverted. The reviewer who recorded
`PR104-VALIDATE-SCRATCH-DIRECTORIES-PREDICTABLE-AND-UNRECLAIMED` pre-created
`$TMPDIR/upstroke-validate-sample-<pid>/foreign-sentinel`, ran a test in this
region, and watched it pass having deleted the sentinel. So this test stands
a stranger at exactly the name the pid-derived helper would have chosen for
the tag it is given, and asserts the file is still there afterwards.

The tag carries a fresh ULID so that the stand-in does not collide with
another run of this test — not because that makes it unguessable, which it
does not. What keeps the stand-in honest is that it is obtained through
[`ForeignRoot::acquire`], which refuses an occupied name: if somebody else
holds the path this test computed, the test fails naming it and destroys
nothing. An earlier version of this test took the path with `create_dir_all`
instead and deleted whatever was there, which is the defect it exists to
disprove, committed inside the disproof.

The other two assertions are what stops the first from being satisfied
cheaply: two calls with one tag in one process must not share a root, which
is the property a pid alone cannot give; and the root must be gone once its
guard drops.

## `fn every_fixture_owns_its_hermetic_root_and_pools_file() {`

The same properties for the fixture the other twenty-odd tests in this region
reach through [`opts`] rather than through [`scratch_root`] directly: two
fixtures share neither their config root nor their pools file, and both are
reclaimed when the first is dropped.

## `options.config_path = Some(PathBuf::from("fixtures/annotation-invalid-plan.md"));`

This tracked Markdown fixture is deliberately invalid TOML.

## `let root = scratch_root("capturedset");`

Completeness is the property, and it is the one an incomplete capture
silently loses: a caller comparing two equal captures concludes
nothing moved, so anything outside the comparison is free to move.
The plan, the repo config, the pools file, and the three worktree
files the gate derivation consults are the whole set.

## `let root = scratch_root("capturedplan");`

The plan is an input like any other, and it was the one an earlier
capture left out. Same interleaving as the config's: capture, let the
file become something else for exactly as long as the parse takes,
restore it. What comes back has to describe the captured plan.

## `let root = scratch_root("capturedgates");`

`gates::derive` takes a directory, so these three are captured rather
than consumed — which makes it worth proving they are genuinely
inputs, and that a change to one of them is a change the capture sees.

## `let pins = vec![config::Pin {`

Every catalogued agent has an adapter as of step 9, so the guard is
driven directly rather than through a config file it can no longer be
reached from. §13 ships the catalog ahead of adapter support, which is
when this fires for real.

## `let pins = vec![config::Pin {`

And it passes what this build really does ship.

## `let root = scratch_root("review");`

§18: `validate` and `--dry-run` execute nothing, so they cannot check
that a named reviewer is installed. Saying "would be, if installed"
is the difference between a plan and a promise.

## `let rotate = rendered`

The per-task decision belongs in the row that explains what this
task's paths bought it — and only on the task whose paths matched.

## `assert!(`

D2's seam is echoed even though nothing acts on it.

## `assert!(`

§13's conservatism, visible: an unmeasured pool reads as unknown, and
the block says that is not the same as full.

## `assert!(`

A source the estimate did not read must not pass as accounted for.

## `assert!(rendered.contains("never probes"), "rendered:\n{rendered}");`

§18: this command executes nothing, and says which side of that line
it is on rather than letting a preview read as a promise.

## `let report = run(&opts("fixtures/sample-plan.md")).expect("validates");`

Hermetic root with no markers: no gates, still explicit.

## `let clean = run(&opts("fixtures/sample-plan.md")).expect("sample validates");`

The sample plan wires artifacts along its dependency chain — silent.
