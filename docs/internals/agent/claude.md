## Module

Claude Code adapter (DESIGN.md §16).

`claude -p` with the prompt on stdin, `--output-format json` parsed
defensively, `--model`, `--effort`, `--max-turns`, `--resume` for same-rung retries.
Permissions are never the skip-all flag: [`permission_settings`] generates
a narrow per-run settings JSON the engine materializes to a file and this
adapter passes via `--settings`, keeping the workspace's own
`.claude/settings.json` untouched.

## `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, clippy::disallowed_macros)]`

LEGACY-EFFECT: this module is in the **frozen legacy section** of
`effects/allowlist.toml`, which carries its justification and the condition
under which the section shrinks. `decisions.effect_site_inventory.mechanism` (2).

## `const PROBE_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(60);`

Budget for one probe call.

Sixty seconds for `--version` looks absurd until you watch it: this CLI is a
Node program behind an npm shim that runs an update check on startup, and it
takes ~5s warm on an unloaded machine. Under a loaded one — a full test
suite, a CI runner, a laptop doing anything else — 15s was not enough, and
the failure mode is the expensive one: §19 makes a probe failure a refusal
to START, so a slow machine loses the whole run rather than one attempt.

Probing happens once per run at pre-flight, so the cost of being generous
here is bounded and paid only when something is genuinely wrong. Waiting a
minute before refusing beats refusing a working machine in fifteen seconds.

## `mod probe_ordinal {`

Which of this adapter's pre-flight processes each identity is.

A named table rather than a counter, for the reason
[`super::probe_request`] gives: an ordinal is a property of the *step*, so
two pre-flights of one machine mint the same identities whether or not an
earlier step was skipped. Dense from 0, and pairwise distinct — asserted by
`every_preflight_process_has_its_own_ordinal`.

## `mod probe_ordinal` › `pub const ALL: [u32; 3] = [VERSION, HELP, AUTH_STATUS];`

Every ordinal above, for the uniqueness assertion.

## `fn probe(&self, runner: &dyn Runner) -> Result<Caps, UpstrokeError> {` › `let help = runner.run_blocking(&probe_request(`

Capabilities are read from `--help`, not assumed: this CLI has
removed and hidden flags between releases, and a missing flag must
surface as a pre-flight refusal rather than as per-task failures
once a run is already spending (§16, §19).

## `fn probe(&self, runner: &dyn Runner) -> Result<Caps, UpstrokeError> {` › `read_only_mode: true,`

No single flag; achieved through the permission settings.

## `fn build(&self, run: &TaskRun) -> Result<CommandSpec, UpstrokeError> {` › `cli().spec(&build_args(run))`

No `current_dir`: the workspace is the runner's, carried on
`RunnerRequest.workspace` (DESIGN.md:118 — the runner "owns cwd").
No resolution either: `cli()` names the CLI and the runner decides
which file that is, so this and `probe` above send one program
string by construction.

## `impl AgentAdapter for ClaudeCodeAdapter` › `fn discover`

`claude auth status --json` — a zero-spend auth probe that handles no
token and reads no credential file: the CLI answers about itself, and
this reads its answer.

## `fn discover` › `discovery.notes.push(`

§13's tier classification comes from the catalog either way, but
saying so is what stops the pools file reading as though the roster
had been confirmed against this machine.

## `fn effort_flag(effort: Effort) -> &'static str {`

Argument list, kept separate from binary resolution so it is testable on
machines without the CLI installed.

## `pub fn build_args(run: &TaskRun) -> Vec<String>` › `"--permission-mode".to_owned(),`

Anything not explicitly allowed is denied rather than prompted:
an unattended run must never sit waiting on a permission question.

## `pub fn build_args(run: &TaskRun) -> Vec<String>` › `"--setting-sources".to_owned(),`

Load NO user/project/local settings: the per-run settings file is
the whole permission surface. Without this, allow rules from
~/.claude/settings.json (or a repo's own .claude/settings.json)
union with ours and silently widen the sandbox (§20).

## `pub fn permission_settings(profile: &WorkerProfile, gate_cmds: &[String]) -> Value {`

Narrow per-run permission settings (§20): edit profiles get file tools plus
exactly the gate commands; reviewers are read-only. Nobody gets network
tools. The engine writes this JSON to the run directory and the command
carries it via `--settings`.

## `pub fn permission_settings(profile: &WorkerProfile, gate_cmds: &[String]) -> Value {` › `"deny": [`

No network tools; and no writing to the files that decide what
later attempts may do — an agent that can edit .claude/ or
.git/ config escalates its own permissions for the rest of the
run (invariant 1 and §20).

`.upstroke/` joins them now that `events.jsonl` is the source of
truth: an agent that can append to it could forge a
`task_committed`, and one that can truncate it could erase its
own failures. Writes there are also never legitimate — the
engine owns that directory the way it owns git.

The `Read` denials are defence in depth rather than the
mechanism. A gate runs repository code the implementer just
wrote, and that code can read any workspace path no permission
rule ever sees. The actual guarantee comes from §15's split:
transcripts, verdicts, and settings live outside the workspace,
where there is no path to them at all.

## `fn parse_output(out: &ProcessOutput) -> Outcome {`

Defensive outcome parsing: the JSON result is trusted when present, but a
missing or malformed field never panics and never fails the parse — status
degrades to `AgentError` instead. Diff, transcript path, and pool drain
are engine-owned and left empty here.

## `fn parse_output(out: &ProcessOutput) -> Outcome` › `outcome.detail = result_text;`

The agent's final message, not just error text: the reviewer's
verdict travels in exactly this field on the SUCCESS path, so
leaving it None here makes every review unparseable.

## `fn parse_output(out: &ProcessOutput) -> Outcome` › `let rate_limited = looks_rate_limited(&out.stderr)`

Rate-limit detection only applies to failures: a SUCCESSFUL task about
rate limiting ("added backoff for 429 responses") must never be read as
the pool being exhausted.

## `fn parse_output(out: &ProcessOutput) -> Outcome` › `outcome.detail = first_non_empty([`

Give the engine something to report: the CLI signals most failures
through the JSON body with an empty stderr.

## `fn parse_auth_status(out: &ProcessOutput) -> Discovery {`

Read `claude auth status --json`, as defensively as every other payload this
adapter parses: a missing or malformed field yields
[`AuthState::Unknown`], never an error and never a confident wrong answer.

The observed signed-out shape (Aug 2026) is
`{"loggedIn": bool, "authMethod": "…", "apiProvider": "…"}`; signed in
(observed 2026-08-10, Max plan) it grows `email`, `orgId`, `orgName`, and
`subscriptionType: "max"`. `loggedIn` drives the auth state; the rest
distinguish §13's two billing shapes — a subscription window from api-key
dollars — because that decides which estimator rule the written pool gets,
and `subscriptionType` is the definitive one where present.

## `fn parse_auth_status(out: &ProcessOutput) -> Discovery` › `return discovery.with_note(format!(`

A non-zero exit with no JSON is the shape an older CLI without the
subcommand leaves. Not being able to ask is not the same as an
answer, so it stays Unknown.

## `fn parse_auth_status(out: &ProcessOutput) -> Discovery` › `let subscription = payload`

Only present while signed in (observed 2026-08-10: `"max"`), and the one
field that names the billing relationship outright rather than implying
it — an enterprise SSO whose `authMethod` matches no token still says
`subscriptionType: "enterprise"` here.

## `fn classify_shape`

§13's two billing shapes, from what the CLI says about the account.

Whole tokens against known sets, not substrings. Substring matching read
"api" and "pro" out of the middle of unrelated words — `pro` sits inside
`provider` — and, worse, tested the api-key set first, so a description
carrying both an api-ish and a subscription-ish word came out as `ApiKey`.

A wrong answer here is worse than no answer, and asymmetrically so:
`connect` prints "kind below is a default, not something detected" only when
this returns `None`, so a confident misclassification is written into the
pools file with the caveat suppressed. Anything ambiguous — a description
matching both sets, or neither — is therefore `None` on purpose.

## `fn classify_shape` › `_ => None,`

Both or neither: say so by saying nothing, and let the writer mark
the pool's kind as the default it is.

## `fn parse_usage(payload: &Value) -> Option<Usage>` › `reasoning_output_tokens: None,`

This CLI reports its own api-equivalent dollars and does not break
output tokens down further, so the field stays empty here rather
than being invented from a subtraction.

## `const CLI: &str = "claude";`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Binary discovery — Windows-first-class: the CLI may be a native claude.exe
or an npm claude.cmd shim, which CreateProcess cannot exec directly. The
mechanics live in `super::bin`, shared with every other adapter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `const CLI: &str = "claude";`

This CLI, as the boundary that will execute it names it.

One name, not a platform-dependent candidate list. Choosing between
`claude.exe`, `claude.cmd` and `claude.bat` was a *filesystem lookup*, and
this adapter no longer performs one: on Windows the extension search is
`PATHEXT`'s and belongs to whatever resolves the name, and inside a
container image there is no extension to search. `gates::ShellKind::spec`
has always named `cmd` and `pwsh` exactly this way.

## `const INSTALL_HINT: &str = "Install Claude Code there, or select a different agent.";`

What to tell an operator whose boundary has no `claude`.

## `fn no_profile_may_write_to_the_run_record()` › `for permissions in [PermissionMode::Edit, PermissionMode::ReadOnly] {`

The event log is the source of truth (invariant 4). An agent that
could append to it could forge a `task_committed`; one that could
truncate it could erase its own failures. Neither is a permission a
worker or a reviewer has any legitimate use for.

## `fn no_profile_may_write_to_the_run_record()` › `assert!(deny.contains("Read(.upstroke/**)"), "{deny}");`

Defence in depth only — the enforceable half of withholding is
§15's split, which puts transcripts outside the workspace where
no rule is needed.

## `fn successful_json_parses_to_completed()` › `assert_eq!(outcome.duration, out.duration);`

What the supervisor measured, carried through unchanged. Nothing
downstream re-derives it — the engine copies `Outcome.duration` into
the attempt record and the report sums those — so an adapter that
dropped it would report every attempt as instantaneous with the whole
suite green (`invariants_preserved[0]`, "adapter parsing unchanged").

## `fn a_successful_task_about_rate_limits_is_not_rate_limited()` › `let stdout = r#"{"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,`

The agent's own summary mentioning 429s must not be read as the
pool being exhausted — that would roll back verified work.

## `fn json_error_failures_carry_a_reportable_detail()` › `let stdout = r#"{"is_error":true,"subtype":"error_during_execution"}"#;`

Falls back to the subtype, then stderr, then a pointer.

## `mod tests` › `fn every_preflight_process_has_its_own_ordinal() {`

Every pre-flight process of this adapter carries its own identity.

`decisions.admission_and_leases.permits.invocation_identity` says
"unique **per process**", and this adapter runs 3 of them, so the
ordinals it fixes must be 3 distinct values. The expected count is
written here from the steps the adapter performs, not read from the
table under test — a table that lost an entry would otherwise agree
with itself.

## `fn every_preflight_process_has_its_own_ordinal()` › `let ids: BTreeSet<String> = probe_ordinal::ALL`

And they really do render as 3 distinct identities of the packet's
third form, which is the property the ordinals exist for.

## `mod tests` › `fn probe_against_real_binary_when_present() {`

Runs only where the real CLI exists; skips silently elsewhere so CI
without Claude Code stays green.

## `fn probe_against_real_binary_when_present()` › `if crate::util::find_program(CLI).is_none() {`

The host runner's boundary *is* this machine, so what gates this is
whether this machine has the CLI — asked of `util::find_program`
rather than of the adapter, which no longer knows.

## `fn auth_status_reads_the_signed_in_shape_including_the_plan` › `let signed_in = output(`

Verbatim field set observed on a real signed-in machine (2026-08-10,
Max plan), identifiers dummied. `subscriptionType` is the definitive
billing field: it must classify even if `authMethod` were something
no token matches (an enterprise SSO spelling, say).

## `fn auth_status_reads_the_signed_in_shape_including_the_plan` › `let sso = output(`

The same payload with an unrecognized auth method still classifies,
because subscriptionType alone names the billing relationship.

## `fn auth_status_reads_the_signed_in_shape_including_the_plan` › `let signed_out = output(`

Signed out (verbatim from this machine, earlier the same day): no
subscriptionType, nothing conclusive — shape honestly None.
