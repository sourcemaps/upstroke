## Module

The coordinator's ambient kill-on-close Job Object (INV-18), and the
process-wide reclaim scope its cleanup reapers read.

Split out of `src/agent/proc.rs`. Every Win32 call this makes is made for it
by `windows_job`, which stays in the parent beside the private
per-invocation job it owns; the reclaim scope is handed to `termination`,
which stays there too. What lives here is the process-wide half of
containment -- established once, held for the life of the process -- as
against the per-invocation half the parent supervises.

**What the citations in this module are.** `INV-18`, `crash_reconstruction`,
`decisions.effect_site_inventory.containment_sub_effects` and
`decisions.admission_and_leases.permits.os_matrix` are the wording of the
retired v0.2 packet, quoted as what this module was built to and as its own
reasoning, never as authority. The design's sentence on Windows containment
(`design/15`, "Current host-process crash containment is deliberately
platform-specific") describes the private per-invocation Job Object and says
nothing of the ambient one, and no public document defines `INV-18`, though
the refusal below names it to the operator. `SWEEP-AMBIENT-002` is the open
row for that gap; it is the owner's to close, not this module's.

**What this module reads from its environment: nothing.** No environment
variable, argument, working directory or file is read here. The inputs are
the caller's observer, the join step `windows_job` performs against the
kernel, and a caller-built [`ReaperContainerScope`]. The environment reads
reachable from this file are all downstream of
[`set_container_reclaim_scope`], on Unix, in `termination`'s resolution of a
bare reaper program (`resolve_reaper_program`, over
`crate::util::find_program`): this process's `PATH`; through it the working
directory, because a relative `PATH` entry is joined to the name and the
result kept relative; and the filesystem's metadata at the moment of the
probe, since the first entry naming a regular file wins. A name no entry
resolves to a regular file is refused rather than defaulted. Two things are
not refused, and both are `termination`'s (row 51): a regular file that is
not executable is accepted, and a reaper handed it reads its own failed
`execv` as an empty listing (`SWEEP-AMBIENT-012`); and the resolution is
made again as each reaper starts, where a failure is folded into no scope
(`SWEEP-AMBIENT-010`).

`PR6-LANEF-004`: it states its own lint level rather than inheriting the
funnel's `#![allow]`, and denies all three governed lints. No
`effects/allowlist.toml` row: a denial needs none.

## `use crate::topology::effects::{InjectionMode, SubEffectPoint};`

The applier and the two mode/point vocabularies are consulted only by the
Windows join below; on every other platform this module answers `Ok`
without reaching a containment point at all, so an ungated import here would
be an unused import under the `-D warnings` the Windows leg runs with.

## `use super::windows_job;`

The Win32 half of every call below is made by the parent's `windows_job`,
which stays there beside the private per-invocation job it owns.

## `pub fn join_ambient_job(hooks: &mut dyn SpawnHooks) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {`

Join the coordinator's ambient kill-on-close Job Object (INV-18).

> on Windows every host child is a member of the coordinator's ambient
> kill-on-close Job Object from creation

enforced by "ambient job joined at write-command startup (refusal
otherwise)". Idempotent: the job is a process-wide singleton established
once and held for the life of the process, because a handle that is ever
closed deliberately would terminate every member — including, since the
coordinator joins it too, the coordinator.

This closes the window the private per-invocation job cannot: between
`CreateProcess` and `AssignProcessToJobObject` the child belongs to no
private job, so a coordinator killed in that window used to leave a
suspended stub with no owner. A child created by an ambient-job member is a
member at creation, so there is no such window.

On Unix this does nothing and says so: containment there is the isolated
process group and the per-invocation reaper, and the packet declares
`AmbientJobJoined` a Windows point
(`decisions.effect_site_inventory.containment_sub_effects`). The hook is not
consulted here either — recording a Windows containment point as executed
on a Unix host would let a Linux CI cell claim Windows coverage.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] with a diagnostic when the job cannot be created
or joined, or when the observer refuses at `Spawn.AmbientJobJoined`;
[`join_ambient_job_with`] says which wording each carries. The caller
refuses the write command before any effect.

## `pub(super) fn join_ambient_job_with(`

[`join_ambient_job`] over an explicit join step.

The parameter exists because the real one cannot fail twice: `join_ambient`
memoises its answer in a process-wide `OnceLock` — it must, since the
coordinator joins exactly one ambient job for its whole life — so a test
binary that has ever joined successfully can never again observe a failure,
and one that observes a failure can never join. The suite's only ambient
failure was therefore the *injected* one, which fires **before** this step
and so proves nothing about what this function does with a real error: the
call could be `let _ = windows_job::join_ambient();` and every test would
still pass while `run` and `resume` dispatched with no ambient job at all.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`], with one of three messages:

* [`AMBIENT_REFUSAL_PREFIX`] followed by [`AMBIENT_REFUSAL_SIMULATED`] when
  the observer answers `Error` at the error-return coordinate. That is
  before this call's join, so this call establishes nothing — but a job an
  earlier call established stays, because the memo is process-wide and
  nothing here can close it. `ambient_job_established` therefore answers
  for the process, not for the call, and the callers count establishments
  per call instead (`runner::host::containment_establishments`);
* [`AMBIENT_REFUSAL_PREFIX`] followed by `join`'s own diagnostic and
  "No process was spawned" when the join fails;
* the funnel's own wording ("the process funnel was made to fail at its
  `AmbientJobJoined` containment step") when the observer answers
  `Error` at the kill coordinate, which is *after* a join that succeeded.
  Only a hand-written observer can answer so — the harness keys each
  answer by mode — and it is surfaced rather than ignored, as
  [`super::hooks::apply_io`] surfaces an `Error` at a kill-only point. The
  job stays established: the memo is this process's one answer, and a later
  caller joins at no cost.

## `apply(`

The error-return coordinate is *before* the join: the point's error
contract is "failure refuses the write command", so an injected failure
stands in place of establishing the job rather than following a job that
was in fact established. A refusal here establishes no job in this call
(an earlier call's stays), creates no child, and leaves nothing to
reclaim.

## `apply(`

The kill coordinate is *after* it, because that is where the point's own
claim is true: "a coordinator kill after any of these leaves no host
process (the ambient handle closes and the kernel terminates the stub or
tree)". Injected before the join there would be no handle to close, and
the observation would sit on the wrong side of the sub-effect it names.

## `pub fn join_ambient_job(_hooks: &mut dyn SpawnHooks) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {`

See the Windows implementation. On Unix this is a no-op that returns `Ok`
and consults no observer; `proc::tests::
the_unix_ambient_join_is_a_no_op_that_consults_no_observer` pins both.

### Errors

Never on Unix.

## `pub const AMBIENT_REFUSAL_PREFIX: &str = concat!(`

The opening words of every ambient-job refusal, so a caller and a test can
recognise one without matching on a whole sentence.

## `pub const AMBIENT_REFUSAL_SIMULATED: &str = concat!(`

The tail of the refusal an injected join failure produces.

## `pub fn process_alive(pid: u32, creation_time: u64) -> bool {`

Whether the process `pid` created at `creation_time` is still running.

The pid alone is not an identity — Windows reuses pids — so both halves are
checked, and "running" is `WaitForSingleObject` timing out rather than an
exit code, because a job-terminated process's exit code is not ours to
predict. A pid that cannot be opened, or that opens onto a process created
at another time, is not this process.

## `pub fn process_creation_time(pid: u32) -> Option<u64> {`

When the process `pid` was created, as a raw FILETIME, or `None` if it
cannot be opened or `GetProcessTimes` declines to answer for it.

## `pub fn ambient_job_established() -> bool {`

Whether this process has joined its ambient Job Object.

## `pub fn child_in_ambient_job(pid: u32) -> Option<bool> {`

Whether `pid` is a member of this process's ambient Job Object, or `None`
when there is no ambient job, the process cannot be opened, or
`IsProcessInJob` itself fails.

INV-18's claim, asked of the kernel: "every host child is a member of the
coordinator's ambient kill-on-close Job Object from creation".

Three causes share one `None`. This is a test oracle, and its one caller
treats anything but `Some(true)` as the claim failing
(`runner::host::tests::windows_ambient_job_terminates_suspended_stub_after_coordinator_death`),
so the fold cannot pass a test vacuously; an answer that says which cause
belongs with `windows_job::ambient_contains` in the parent.

## `pub(crate) fn poison_ambient_for_tests(message: &str) -> bool {`

Memoise an ambient establishment **failure**, before anything has joined.

Test-only, and it spends this process's one ambient cell — so it belongs
only in a subprocess helper. It exists because the failure it plants is the
one no machine can produce on demand: `CreateJobObjectW` and
`AssignProcessToJobObject` succeed on a working Windows host, and the memo
means a process only ever sees one answer. Returns whether the cell was
still free, which a caller must check: a helper whose poison did not land
measures nothing.

## `pub fn set_container_reclaim_scope(`

Arm this process's cleanup reapers to kill the coordinator's labeled
containers when the coordinator dies, or disarm them with `None`.

`decisions.admission_and_leases.permits.os_matrix`, in full:

> Linux and macOS (`cfg(unix)`): the cleanup reaper survives coordinator
> death, settles the dead coordinator's process groups while holding R28,
> and **additionally kills the dead coordinator's labeled containers**,
> closing the orphan window; Windows: **no reaper**; … containers are
> reclaimed at the **next write-command start** (orphan window until then;
> documented; a portable watchdog is deferred).

So this is a **no-op on Windows**, and that is the documented half rather
than an omission: [`crate::runner::container::orphan_window`] is the value
that says so and `runner::container::tests::windows_orphan_window_documented`
is what asserts the platform and the code agree — for this function too, by
arming a scope no platform could exec and requiring the refusal exactly
where a reaper exists.

The scope is read **before** the fork, by every reaper started after this
call: a reaper already running keeps the scope it was started with, because
it is a `fork`-only child that cannot be handed anything afterwards.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when the scope cannot become the argument vectors
a reaper will `execv` — decided here, where there is still an error channel,
rather than inside a reaper that has none:

* its program has no path separator and no `PATH` entry joined to it names
  a regular file, or the name is not UTF-8 and so cannot be looked up
  (`termination::resolve_reaper_program`, over `crate::util::find_program`).
  What that probe reads is `PATH`, the working directory for a relative
  entry, and the filesystem's metadata; it asks `is_file`, not whether the
  file is executable, so a non-executable `docker` on `PATH` is accepted
  here and fails inside the reaper instead (`SWEEP-AMBIENT-012`);
* a rendered string carries an interior NUL
  (`termination::render_container_argv`).

## `pub fn set_container_reclaim_scope(`

See the Unix implementation. On Windows this is a no-op that returns `Ok`
without examining the scope: `os_matrix` gives Windows no reaper, so there
is nothing to arm and nothing to refuse for, and
`runner::container::tests::windows_orphan_window_documented` requires this
call to accept a scope the Unix arm refuses.

### Errors

Never on Windows.
