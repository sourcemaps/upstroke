## Module

The funnel's observation and injection surface: the trait a watcher
implements, the do-nothing observer production passes, and the two appliers
that turn an answer back into control flow.

Split out of `src/agent/proc.rs`, whose supervision primitives consult these
at every containment step. Nothing here starts, signals or waits on a
process: it decides what the caller must do next and returns.

`PR6-LANEF-004`: a Rust lint level is scoped by the module tree and not by
the file, so this file would inherit the funnel's `#![allow]` of the three
governed lints without saying so. It denies all three instead, and carries no
`effects/allowlist.toml` row -- a denial needs none; only an allowance does.

## `pub trait SpawnHooks {`

The parent-side containment steps of one spawn, told to whoever is watching.

`decisions.effect_site_inventory.containment_sub_effects`: "the process
funnel exposes hook points for platform containment steps, each a
Topology/Shared site with documented residue and recovery". PR3 declared the
eight points ([`SubEffectPoint`]); PR4 makes them execute, and this is the
interface through which they do.

Production passes [`NoHooks`], which answers [`Injection::Proceed`] to
everything and costs a virtual call per containment step. The ST-07 subset
passes [`crate::runner::HarnessHooks`], which records into PR3's
`HookHarness` and returns whatever the suite armed.

## `pub trait SpawnHooks` › `fn point(&mut self, point: SubEffectPoint) -> Injection;`

The funnel reached `point`. The answer says what it must do there.

## `pub trait SpawnHooks` › `fn point_mode(&mut self, point: SubEffectPoint, mode: InjectionMode) -> Injection {`

The funnel reached `point`, at the coordinate that mode's fault belongs
at.

A point whose two modes fire at two coordinates cannot be consulted
once. `Spawn.AmbientJobJoined` is the one:
`containment_sub_effects` gives it an error contract — "failure refuses
the write command" — which stands *in place of* establishing the job, so
it is consulted **before** the join; and it gives it the kill claim "a
coordinator kill after any of these leaves no host process (the ambient
handle closes …)", which is only true **after** the join, because before
it there is no handle to close.

The default answers with [`Self::point`], so an observer that does not
distinguish modes behaves exactly as it did.

## `pub trait SpawnHooks` › `fn phase(&mut self, site: ProcessSite, phase: HookPhase) -> Injection {`

The funnel reached one of the two hook phases of `Process.Spawn` or
`Process.Terminate`: before and after the spawn primitive, before and after
a termination. The two process sites had every parent-side point observed
and neither hook phase (`PR10`'s round-2 contract lens, ST-07 over the full
inventory), because the trait had nothing to consult for a phase; this is
that consultation, with the same answer vocabulary as a point. The default
proceeds, so every observer that only distinguishes points behaves as it
did; [`crate::runner::HarnessHooks`] records the phase under the site's own
key, which is what the merge check's bijection reads.

## `pub trait SpawnHooks` › `fn child_created(&mut self, _pid: u32) {}`

The funnel created a child and has not yet contained it.

Called between `CreateProcess`/`fork` and the next containment step, so
an observer that is about to inject a kill can record the identity that
must not survive the coordinator. The Windows stub test needs the pid
*and* the creation time, because Windows reuses pids, and only the
funnel knows the pid before it dies.

## `pub struct NoHooks;`

What production passes: nothing is armed and nothing is recorded.

## `pub(super) fn apply_phase(`

[`apply`] for a hook phase: the same three answers, the refusal naming the
site and the phase instead of a point. The funnel applies a `Spawn` before
answer before anything is created and an after answer once the child is
registered — an error there kills the tree it just made, as the
register-failure arm does, so an injected fault after the spawn leaves no
process behind; the `Terminate` phases bracket the kill itself.

## `pub(super) fn apply(injection: Injection, point: SubEffectPoint) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {`

Do what a hook answered.

[`Injection::Kill`] aborts. Not `panic!` and not `std::process::exit`: the
whole claim under test is that a coordinator which dies **without running
any cleanup** still leaves no host process, and the three deaths differ in
exactly the cleanup they run.

`panic!` unwinds. The panicking thread's stack destructors run — including
the one that closes the very job handle whose close-on-death is the
mechanism — so the coordinator would be dismantling its own containment on
the way out, which is the opposite of the death being modelled.

`std::process::exit` runs **no** stack destructors, on its own stack or on
any other thread's; an earlier wording here said that it ran them, and that
was wrong. It is still not this death, because it is the *orderly* exit: it
hands the code to the platform's normal shutdown, which runs the
process-exit handlers registered with it (`atexit` on a glibc target).
Registered handlers are cleanup, and which of them a given platform runs is
not something this claim should have to depend on.

`std::process::abort` runs neither. Termination is abrupt: no clean-up is
performed and no destructors run, so whatever becomes of the child after it
is the operating system's doing and not ours — which is exactly what the
containment claim asserts.

## `fn apply_io`

[`apply`] for the funnel steps whose only declared mode is `Kill`.

`SubEffectPoint::modes` gives every containment point except
`AmbientJobJoined` kill mode alone, because the packet gives only the
ambient join an error contract to return through ("failure refuses the
write command"). An `Error` here can therefore only come from a hand-written
observer, and it is surfaced as a spawn failure rather than silently
ignored.
