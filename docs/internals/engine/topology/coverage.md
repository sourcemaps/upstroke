## Module

ST-07 for the sequential topology over the full claimed inventory: the claims — for every hook
phase and every parent-side point in every injection mode of every Topology- and Shared-scoped
site, the committed test the suite's observation export shows executing it — the residue-class
evidence (the declarations for the ordinary tests, the observed histograms for the merge check
and the regenerator), the fast-path no-execution record, the registry document built from all
of them through `FaultRegistry::insert` and pinned at `effects/sequential-registry.json`, and
the authority for a recovery-proven entry's frozen N (`SWEEP-BIJECTION-005`). Nothing is
declared unobservable: the round-1 document excused six coordinates (`Report.Write`'s two
phases, `Process.Spawn`'s and `Process.Terminate`'s) with reasons held to the code, and PR10's
round 2 made each execute instead — the report funnel consults `Report.Write` around the one
write, the process funnel consults `SpawnHooks::phase` before and after the spawn and around
every termination — so the bijection is over the whole inventory with no exclusion.

The export itself is `src/observations.rs`'s: every harness adapter writes what its harness
observed under `UPSTROKE_HOOK_OBSERVATIONS` when its last clone drops and just before a kill
injection is handed back. The merge check (`coverage/tests.rs`,
`st07_the_sequential_range_is_a_bijection_over_the_exported_observations`, ignored) rebuilds one
harness from the funnel executions of a full run's export, runs `check_bijection` over the
whole inventory at the current host and requires it empty, holds the fast sequences and every
claim this host requires to the export, and holds every recovery-proven N to the declarations.
The non-ignored tests hold the document to the tree, and read only tracked files: the residue
half of their evidence is built from `effects/residue-classes.json` (the frozen N, an empty
histogram, nothing unclassified), so a fresh checkout with no observed histogram passes them —
the round-2 regression lens found them reading the gitignored histogram.

## `pub fn load_observations(dir: &Path) -> Result<Vec<ObservationRecord>, String> {`

Every record under the export directory, records of one test merged.

## `pub fn harness_from(records: &[ObservationRecord]) -> HookHarness {`

A harness that has seen what the records say, replayed through `HookHarness::hook`: a point is
armed and hooked so the injection fires and the execution is recorded as an execution, never
written into the harness by hand.

## `pub struct Claim {`

One coordinate of the inventory and the test that executes it.

## `pub fn hook_entry(claim: &Claim) -> RegistryEntry {`

The entry the claim builds: the site's own semantics for the phase (rows, residue detail,
resume action), the site's one observable order or none, and `Executed { test, passed: true }`.
Every field `validate_entry` checks is read from the site, so a claim cannot table a residue
the site does not leave.

## `pub fn required_phases(site: EffectSiteId, host: Host) -> Vec<EntryPhase> {`

What the bijection asks of a site on a host: both hook phases and every point in every mode the
point supports, for the points the host has.

## `pub fn frozen_sampling_n(declarations: &str, site: EffectSiteId) -> Result<Option<u32>, String> {`

The frozen N for a site, read from `effects/residue-classes.json`'s text — the declarations
half the artifacts test pins — and `None` for a site that declares no residue class.

## `pub const ADAPTER_UNIT_TEST_MODULES: &[&str] = &[`

The tests whose observations are calls on an adapter rather than executions of a funnel — the
adapter unit tests hook the harness through the adapter's own methods to test the adapter. Their
records are left out of the merge check's harness and no claim may name them; the seams bundle's
unit test, for one, arms a Windows-only point on every host, which would otherwise read as that
point executed on Unix.

## `pub fn inventory() -> Vec<EffectSiteId> {`

Every Topology- and Shared-scoped site the enums generate: 68 at this head.

## `pub const FAST_PATH_TEST: &str = "engine::topology::integra…`

The test whose fast-path assertion the no-execution record cites, and
the fast sequences the suite's export records: the record has to name
every one of them (`check_bijection`), and the merge check holds this
list to the export.

## `pub const FAST_PATH_TEST: &str =`

The integrate suite's exact-base fast path, whose assertion the no-execution record cites.

## `pub const FAST_SEQUENCES: &[&str] = &["s0", "exact-base-fas…`

Every fast sequence the suite's funnel executions record: `s0` is the
integrate suite's exact-base fast path; `exact-base-fast` is the
workspace manager lane's exact-base tour
(`workspace_manager::tests::every_site_this_lane_owns_executes_both_hook_phases`).

## `pub const FAST_SEQUENCES: &[&str] = &["s0", "exact-base-fast"];`

Every fast sequence the export's funnel executions record; the no-execution record has to name
each of them, and the merge check holds this list to the export both ways.

## `pub struct ResidueEvidence {`

The two halves of the residue-class evidence. The synthetic records come from one tracked file,
`effects/residue-synthetic.json`, which
`workspace_manager::tests::every_registered_residue_element_is_constructed_and_recovers` holds to
what it constructs, classifies and recovers on every run (regenerated with
`UPSTROKE_REGENERATE_EFFECT_ARTIFACTS=1`, never rewritten by an ordinary run). The sampling
records come from two gitignored, machine-varying files each sampler rewrites on every run:
`effects/residue-histogram.json` (PR5's four-command sampler) and
`effects/residue-histogram-sequential.json`
(`sampled_git_child_kills_of_the_remaining_residue_sites_are_classified_and_recovered` in this
module's tests, which kill-samples the five residue-classified sites PR5's sampler does not run,
each through the argv its funnel shares with it). The ordinary tests read the tracked file and
the declarations (`ResidueEvidence::declared`); only the ignored merge check and the regenerator
read the histograms.

## `impl ResidueEvidence` › `pub fn declared(synthetic_json: &str, declarations_json: &str) -> …`

The evidence the ordinary tests build from tracked files alone: the synthetic records, and for
every declared site a sampling record carrying the declarations' frozen N with nothing observed
— an empty histogram, nothing unclassified, recovered — which is what the sampler asserts of
every run and what the pin sets aside anyway. The observed histograms are read by `parse`, for
the merge check and the regenerator only.

## `impl ResidueEvidence` › `pub fn parse(synthetic_json: &str, histograms: &[&str]) -> …`

# Errors

A file that does not parse, or names a site the enums do not.

## `pub fn residue_entries(evidence: &ResidueEvidence) -> Resul…`

One recovery-proven entry per residue class of every site of the
inventory that registers one.

# Errors

A site whose class has no synthetic or no sampling evidence in `evidence`.

## `pub fn residue_entries(evidence: &ResidueEvidence) -> Result<Vec<RegistryEntry>, String> {`

One recovery-proven entry per residue class of every site of the inventory that registers one —
nine at this head — refusing a site whose class lacks either half.

## `pub const CLAIMS: &[Claim] = &[`

The evidence: for every required phase and point of every site of the inventory on either host,
the committed test that executes it, chosen from the suite's own observation export — 168
claims: 159 coordinates both hosts require, the four Unix-only and the five Windows-only points
of `Process.Spawn`. The six PR10's round 2 added are `Report.Write`'s two phases, claimed by the
finalization kill matrix like `RunDir.WriteReport`'s, and the two phases of `Process.Spawn` and
of `Process.Terminate`, claimed by this suite's own witness, which spawns one command that ends
and one that outlives its timeout through the host runner under the production adapter. A claim is a statement the merge check holds against a fresh export on the
host that requires it; the non-ignored tests hold every claim against the tree. The run-end
sites keep the claims the first document made; the coordinates no other suite executes under
the production adapters are claimed by this module's own witnesses (the question and answer
funnels, every event error-return and kill point, the process funnel's kill points on each host,
the container launch funnels).

## `pub fn registry(evidence: &ResidueEvidence) -> Result<Fault…`

# Errors

An entry the format refuses, or residue evidence a site lacks.

## `pub fn registry(evidence: &ResidueEvidence) -> Result<FaultRegistry, String> {`

The claims' entries, the residue entries and the no-execution records, every one through
`FaultRegistry::insert`.

## `pub fn registry_document(evidence: &ResidueEvidence) -> Res…`

# Errors

See [`registry`].

## `pub fn registry_document(evidence: &ResidueEvidence) -> Result<RegistryDocument, String> {`

The pinned document: a note, the inventory, both hosts, the fast sequences and the entries.
Until PR10's round 2 it also carried the declared-unobservable coordinates with their reasons;
nothing is declared now, and a document that carried the field would not parse.

## `pub fn registry_json(evidence: &ResidueEvidence) -> Result<…`

# Errors

See [`registry`].

## `pub fn without_histograms(mut document: RegistryDocument) -…`

The document with every recovery-proven sampling histogram zeroed: what
the pin compares, the machine-varying half set aside.

## `pub fn without_histograms(mut document: RegistryDocument) -> RegistryDocument {`

The document with every recovery-proven histogram zeroed: the machine-varying half set aside,
which is what the pin compares. The pinned copy of the counts is what the two histogram files
held when the document was regenerated; the merge check reads the files.

## `pub fn check_frozen_n(entries: &[RegistryEntry], declarations: &str) -> Vec<String> {`

SWEEP-BIJECTION-005: the frozen `N` a recovery-proven entry cites is the declarations file's,
not the entry's own. One line per disagreement.
