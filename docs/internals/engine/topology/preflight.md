# `src/engine/topology/preflight.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/engine/topology/preflight.rs`](../../../../src/engine/topology/preflight.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does; this file is the whole of its prose, moved out of
the source verbatim. Each section is headed by the line of code the comment sat above, spelled
as it is in the source, so the heading is the grep string that finds the code.

## Module

The `RunnerPreflight`: the one observation of shell and CLI availability
inside the run's boundary.

[`crate::runner::container::resolve::RunnerPreflight`] is a **seam with no
production implementation**, and its own module says why: the probes are
`crate::runner::host::run_shell_probe` over the run's Runner, and building
that runner "needs a run identity, a private root and a slot pair that
`TopologyRun` owns at PR7". This is that implementation.

INV-23, which is the whole specification of this file:

> the `RunnerPreflight` — one non-slotted shell probe (the recorded shell
> executing `exit 0`) and one slotted probe per recorded agent, each a
> registered invocation through the run's Runner — executes at P4 and at
> every resume's recovery step (c) and is the only observation of shell and
> CLI availability inside the boundary.

### The asymmetry is the point

The shell probe is **non-slotted** and the agent probes are **slotted**.
`permits.agent_pool_slots` excludes two invocations by name — "gate
invocations and the shell probe acquire no slot" — and
[`crate::engine::topology::is_slotted`] is the total function of the
identity that decides it. Nothing here carries a second flag that could
disagree with the identity: the registration reads `is_slotted` and takes a
pair exactly when it answers `true`, so a shell probe that acquired a slot
would need `is_slotted` to be wrong about `ProbeTarget::Shell`.

### Why the runner is wrapped rather than the probes hand-built

An [`crate::agent::AgentAdapter`]'s `probe` runs **one or more** processes —
Codex runs four — and each is already a `RunnerRequest` carrying its own
`InvocationId` from [`crate::agent::probe_request`]. R4 is "invocation
registration (**all** Runner processes incl. gates, agent probes, and the
shell probe)", so registering only the identities this module could name in
advance would leave three of Codex's four unaccounted and the ledger would
balance while being wrong.

So the ledger sits **at the boundary**: [`Registering`] is a
[`crate::runner::Runner`] that registers, slots, runs and settles every
request that passes through it, whoever built it. That is also what makes
`R3`'s "released on complete or cancel" and `R4`'s "completed or cancelled
exactly once" true of a probe that *fails*, which is the case
`resume_refuses_by_preflight_probe_when_shell_or_cli_fails_before_any_recovery_event`
exercises.

### `certify` takes `&self`

The trait's signature is `fn certify(&self, policy: &RunnerPolicy)`, and an
implementation that allocates identities has to mutate a ledger behind it.
[`std::sync::Mutex`] rather than a `RefCell`: [`crate::runner::Runner`] is
`Send + Sync`, and [`Registering`] is a `Runner`.

## `pub struct Probed {`

What one pre-flight established.

The agents are carried in the order they were probed, because
`run_started(4).probed_agents` and `run_resumed(4).probed_agents` are lists
and a resume's list is compared against the record's.

## `pub struct Probed` › `pub agents: Vec<String>,`

Every agent whose CLI answered, in probe order.

## `pub struct Probed` › `pub caps: Vec<(String, Caps)>,`

What each agent's CLI reported about itself.

## `impl Probed` › `pub fn agents(&self) -> &[String] {`

The agent names, which is what the durable record carries.

## `pub struct RunPreflight<'a> {`

The run's `RunnerPreflight`: a shell probe and one probe per recorded agent.

Holds no `&mut` anything: the [`RunnerPreflight`] trait's `certify` takes
`&self` because `rebuild_from_record` holds the runner and the record while
it calls it.

## `pub struct RunPreflight<'a>` › `ledger: Mutex<InvocationLedger>,`

Every invocation this pre-flight registered, in one process-local
ledger. R4 balances at process end.

## `pub struct RunPreflight<'a>` › `slots: Mutex<SlotAssertion>,`

R3, asserted rather than brokered: one slotted invocation at a time.

## `pub struct RunPreflight<'a>` › `probed: Mutex<Option<Probed>>,`

What the last `certify` established, for the caller that has to record
`probed_agents`.

## `impl<'a> RunPreflight<'a>` › `pub fn new(`

The pre-flight of a run whose recorded shell is `shell` and whose
recorded agents are `agents`.

`workspace` is where the shell probe runs. The agent probes take
[`crate::agent::probe_workspace`] through
[`crate::agent::probe_request`] — "a probe asks a CLI about itself and
has no workspace of its own" — and that decision is the adapter
module's, not this one's.

## `impl<'a> RunPreflight<'a>` › `pub fn probed(&self) -> Option<Probed> {`

What the last successful [`RunnerPreflight::certify`] established.

## `impl<'a> RunPreflight<'a>` › `pub fn ledgers_balance(&self) -> bool {`

Whether every invocation this pre-flight registered was settled exactly
once, and no slot pair is still held.

`resource_accounting` R3/R4 at `NoRunFinished`: "released (process
death; empty at restart)" — but a *refusal* is not a process death, and
a pre-flight that refused while still holding a slot would leave the
resume's own later invocations refused by its own assertion. This is
what `resume_preflight_probe_containers_reclaimed_after_refusal`
asserts alongside the containers.

## `impl<'a> RunPreflight<'a>` › `pub fn settlements(&self) -> (usize, usize) {`

How many probe invocations settled completed, and how many cancelled.

Two numbers because R3 has two rows. A refused spawn is a **cancel** —
the process either never started or produced no outcome this run may act
on — and a boundary that completed it would leave a balanced ledger
saying the opposite of what happened.

## `impl<'a> RunPreflight<'a>` › `pub fn running(&self) -> Vec<String> {`

Every identity still registered as running. Empty once `certify`
returns, on either path.

## `impl<'a> RunPreflight<'a>` › `fn registering(&self) -> Registering<'_> {`

The runner every probe of this pre-flight actually executes through:
the run's Runner, with the registration wrapped around it.

## `impl RunnerPreflight for RunPreflight<'_>` › `fn certify(&self, policy: &RunnerPolicy) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {`

The shell probe, then one probe per recorded agent, in that order.

**The order is the contract's**, and it is not alphabetical or
arbitrary: `recovery_order` (c) writes "the non-slotted shell probe
(recorded shell, exit 0) **and** one slotted probe per recorded agent",
and `runner` adds "probes execute through it **sequentially** at
pre-flight". A shell that cannot run a command is the cheaper refusal
and the one that explains every agent failure that would follow it, so
it goes first and the agent probes are never reached when it fails.

`policy` is not consulted here and that is deliberate: the runner this
executes through was *built* from the record — `rebuild_from_record`
verified the runtime, the recorded image id and the volumes before
calling this — so re-reading the record to decide anything would be
this module deciding a question the rebuild already answered. It is
named in the refusal, which is what a caller needs it for.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] naming the shell or the agent whose CLI did
not answer. Every invocation registered before the refusal is cancelled
and every slot pair released, so the ledgers balance on both paths.

## `fn certify(&self, policy: &RunnerPolicy) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {` › `let shell_id = PreflightIdentities::shell(0)?;`

(1) The shell. Non-slotted, and `is_slotted` is what makes that true
rather than an argument here.

## `fn certify(&self, policy: &RunnerPolicy) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {` › `let mut caps = Vec::with_capacity(self.agents.len());`

(2) One probe per recorded agent, sequentially, in recorded order.

## `fn refused(policy: &RunnerPolicy, what: &str) -> UpstrokeError {`

The refusal shape every pre-flight failure takes.

Names the image the probe ran inside, because "a recorded shell or agent CLI
that fails **inside the recorded image**" is a different fact from the same
CLI failing on the host, and an operator who cannot tell which one has
nothing to fix.

## `pub(super) struct Registering<'a> {`

The run's Runner with R3 and R4 wrapped around every request.

Its own refusals — a registration the ledger refuses, a slotted request
with no slots or no agent, a pair the assertion refuses — are `RunnerError`s
with the fate `NeverStarted`, because they precede the inner Runner; a
release or settlement failure after the inner run carries the inner
outcome's fate (`Gone` for an output, the inner error's for an error), so
the boundary never claims more about the process than the Runner it wraps.

One place, so that "each a registered invocation" is true of a process an
adapter built as much as of one this module built.

**`pub(super)` since 2026-08-27, because "one place" was not true.** Fresh
creation did not use it: `create.rs`'s P4 registered a single
`probe(agent, 0)` identity around the *whole* adapter call and handed the
adapter the raw Runner, so an adapter that runs ten processes — a current
Codex probe runs version, two help probes, six strict-config probes and the
model catalog — put one of them in the ledger. A failure at ordinal 1 was
recorded as ordinal 0 cancelled: the ledger named the process that
*succeeded* and held no record of the one that failed. The `bf927f3` review
found it as its third P1; the doc above was already the argument against it.

## `pub(super) struct Registering<'a>` › `pub(super) slots: Option<&'a Mutex<SlotAssertion>>,`

R4's slots, or `None` on a boundary that has none.

**`Option` because INV-23's asymmetry is a real one**: "one non-slotted
shell probe (the recorded shell executing `exit 0`) **and** one slotted
probe per recorded agent". A boundary built for the shell probe holds no
slots at all — [`super::create::ShellProbe`] is that boundary — so a
slotted invocation arriving on it is refused rather than quietly run
unslotted. The alternative was a second copy of register/slot/run/settle
for the non-slotted case, and this file's own header is that there is
**one place**.

## `impl Runner for Registering<'_>` › `fn run<'a>(&'a self, request: &'a RunnerRequest, call: RunnerCall<'a>) -> RunFuture<'a> {`

Register, slot, run, settle — and settle on the failure path too. Since PR11
the inner Runner's `run` is a future, so the wrapper is one too: `admit`
(register and slot) and `settle` (release and complete or cancel) are
synchronous and run on either side of the one `.await`, so no ledger or slot
guard is ever held across it — which is also what keeps the future `Send`. The
call is forwarded to the inner Runner unchanged, so a cancellation or an
observer the caller carries reaches the process.

The settlement is not in a `Drop`: a `Drop` that swallowed a refusal
would make a ledger that did not balance look like one that did, and
`permits.protocol` asks for "registered/completed/cancelled **exactly
once**". A run that returns `Err` is a **cancel**, not a complete: the
process either never started or did not produce an outcome this run may
act on, and `R3`'s two lifecycle rows are "released on cancel" and
"released on complete or cancel" precisely so the two are told apart.

## `impl Registering<'_>` › `fn admit(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<(), RunnerError> {`

Everything before the inner run: register, then, for a slotted invocation,
take the pair. A refusal after the registration withdraws it before
returning.

## `fn admit(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<(), RunnerError>` › `let withdrawn = |refusal: UpstrokeError| {`

The one withdrawal every refusal after the registration takes: cancel the
registration and return the refusal. The cancel cannot fail here — it settles
the entry this call registered a moment ago — but its result is carried as the
refusal's cleanup (`UpstrokeError::with_cleanup`, which leaves the refusal
unchanged on `Ok`) rather than discarded, so an impossible failure would still
be visible. Before PR11 the three refusal paths each discarded it with
`let _ =`.

## `fn admit(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<(), RunnerError>` › `let Some(slots) = self.slots else {`

The non-slotted boundary cannot account a slotted invocation, and
running it anyway would put an agent probe through a path that
takes no pair — the process would execute with `permits.
agent_pool_slots` never consulted.

## `fn admit(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<(), RunnerError>` › `agent: match request.agent.as_ref() {`

The agent whose per-agent slot this is. A slotted invocation
without an agent binding cannot be accounted, and refusing is
the assertion rather than inventing a name for it.

## `fn admit(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<(), RunnerError>` › `pool: None,`

The pool is the routing layer's and arrives with PR11's
broker; a per-agent pair with no pool is the sequential
substrate's assertion, which is what R3 is here.

## `impl Registering<'_>` › `fn settle(`

Everything after the inner run: release the pair, then complete the
registration on an output or cancel it on an error, exactly once. A release or
settlement failure carries the inner outcome's fate.
