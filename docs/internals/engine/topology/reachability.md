## Module

The resume classifier the bounded census runs over every explored state (ST-14: "the explorer
… classifies every reachable state with a resume action by running the recovery classifier over
it"). It lives in the engine because `src/topology/**` is frozen and the census tests (Class A)
call into it; nothing here mutates a fold.

## `pub enum ResumeAction {`

What a fresh process would do with the fold: nothing (not started), finalize then refuse
(Complete or Halted — "Complete and Halted classify as finalize-then-terminal"), or recover by
a plan.

## `pub struct RecoveryPlan {`

The recovery order's steps as a plan read from the fold: what reopens the run (a Parked or
BudgetExceeded end), the in-flight identities to settle interrupted (d), the retained
generations to close (e), the promoting generations to complete (f), the open generations to
recreate (g), the pending publication or verification (f), what `run_resumed` wakes, and the
halt and derivation for the summary — and, since PR10's round 2, the items the three rows that
need no recovery event are about: the closed generations whose slots the resume reclaims
(`reclaims`, T-SCRUB), the tasks whose settlement is read from the prefix (`settled`,
T-FAILED) and the registered repairs (`repairs`, T-REJECT). A plan that names none of them is
not those rows' resume action.

## `pub fn classify(fold: &TopologyFold) -> ResumeAction {`

The classification, deterministic in the fold alone — which is what makes "the classification
computed during live emission equals the classification recomputed from the durable prefix
alone" a checkable sentence.

## `struct FoldView {`

What the fold holds for each fault row, read by the audit on its own: the same generation
classes, transaction and questions the classifier reads, walked again in `view` rather than
through the classifier's plan, so a classifier that drops an item cannot also drop the assertion
about it. The audit's mutation witness is exactly that: a `classify` that pushes every open
generation but beta's still reads every T-DISPATCH state through `rows_reached`, and
`matches_row` then finds the plan short of one generation.

## `pub fn rows_reached(fold: &TopologyFold) -> Vec<FaultRow> {`

Which fault rows a state is the durable prefix of, by the shape the row tables and from the fold
alone: an in-flight attempt is T-ATTEMPT's prefix, an open generation without an attempt
T-DISPATCH's, a prepared candidate T-CAND-OBJ's or T-CAND-REF's, and so on through the
twenty-one.

## `pub const fn outside_the_fold(row: FaultRow) -> bool {`

T-CONTAINER and T-APPEND have no fold state to classify — a container's prefix is the runner's
and an append's prefix is the log's — and the summary says so rather than counting them as
unreached.

## `pub fn matches_row(row: FaultRow, fold: &TopologyFold, action: &ResumeAction) -> bool {`

Whether the classifier's answer for this fold is the row's tabled resume action, item by item:
the per-item rows require the plan to name exactly the generations, the transaction or the
question count the fold holds for that row (sorted and compared, not merely non-empty); T-FINISH
a plan that reopens nothing at a run that is ending; T-RESUME and T-FINALIZE the outcome the fold
recorded.

T-SCRUB, T-FAILED and T-REJECT need no recovery event of their own: a scrubbed candidate is
re-scrubbed idempotently, a settled task and a registered repair are read from the prefix. Until
PR10's round 2 any `Recover` satisfied them, and the round's contract lens showed a
`RecoveryPlan::default()` passing as their resume action; now each holds the plan to the items
it is about — the closed generations it reclaims, the settled tasks it reads, the repairs it
carries — sorted and compared like the per-item rows, and the census asserts the empty plan
rejected wherever those rows are reached. Whatever another task in the same state needs is
that task's row. T-ANSWER's open question is read from the prefix too, and the plan's count of
it is held to the fold's.

T-FINISH is a closure in progress: the run is ending (a halting settlement, a budget stop, or
nothing left to select) and no `run_finished` is durable yet. The next process repeats the
closure steps for the classes still open — which is what the plan's other fields carry — then
evaluates `derived_outcome` and appends `run_finished`.

## `pub struct CensusSummary {`

What the G5 gate dumps: every fault row with the states that reach it, every action and every
outcome counted, the bounds the census ran under and whether live and replay classified alike.
The three transition counts are each counted from the outcome the census recorded — accepted,
refused, and the offers the state ceiling truncated (`truncated_offers`) — and sum to the
transitions; until PR10's round 2 the refusals were the remainder after the acceptances, which
counted every truncated offer as a refusal.

## `pub fn summarize(census: &Census, classification_equal_live_and_on_replay: bool) -> CensusSummary {`

Over the census's recorded states and transitions. Serializable, written to
`UPSTROKE_CENSUS_SUMMARY` by the census test that names it.
