# `src/engine/topology/dispatch.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/engine/topology/dispatch.rs`](../../../../src/engine/topology/dispatch.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does; this file is the whole of its prose, moved out of
the source verbatim. Each section is headed by the line of code the comment sat above, spelled
as it is in the source, so the heading is the grep string that finds the code.

## Module

Dispatch: `task_dispatched` → intent → add, and the reuse gate over it.

Two ordering clauses live here and they point in opposite directions, which
is the whole reason they are one module.

**O21 — `task_dispatched` before worktree intent and add.** The event is
written *first*, before anything on disk exists.
[`crate::topology::events::TaskDispatched`] says why in its own doc: "a
worktree created before the event that records it is a directory nothing in
the log accounts for; an event written before a worktree that then fails to
appear is a generation the next process closes". So a fresh dispatch is
`task_dispatched` → `Worktree.WriteIntent` → `Worktree.Add`, and nothing
observes the worktree in between.

**O22 — `Worktree.Verify` before any reuse.** `Verify` guards **reuse**, not
creation. `decisions.workspace_candidates.generation` names its three
occasions exactly — "a worktree is reused across a process boundary or after
an interrupted Git command (OpenNoAttempt recreate-or-verify, repair
materialization, retry verification) **only after** Worktree.Verify" — and
all three are recovery, never the first create. **Two** of them are this
module's — [`verify_or_recreate`] and, through it,
[`resume_open_no_attempt`]. The third, the retry verification, is
[`super::settle::retry`]'s, because a retained worktree that fails is
*closed* rather than recreated (INV-06) and the closure lives with the
reservation it has to cancel. Putting `Verify` in front of
a fresh add would make
`residue_carrying_worktree_fails_verify_and_is_recreated` inexpressible:
there would be no state in which a worktree exists, carries residue, and is
then recreated, because the verify would have run before it existed.

### What is not here

The attempt is [`super::attempt`]'s. Selection, the ceiling and
`budget_exceeded` are `select.rs`'s. The append-error protocol is
`emit.rs`'s, which is why this module takes an [`EventEmitter`] rather than
an [`crate::events::log::EventLog`].

## `pub trait EventEmitter {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The emit seam
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub trait EventEmitter {`

Where a durable schema-4 event goes.

`coordinator_integration.emit` is "build event → serialize → round-trip →
plan_transition → append the exact bytes through the Event funnel", plus the
append-error protocol when that append fails. All of it is **`emit.rs`'s**
(O17), which is a different module of this slice: `dispatch.rs` and
`attempt.rs` decide *what* is appended and *when* relative to the effects
around it, and nothing here may decide *how*.

So the ordering modules take this and never an
[`crate::events::log::EventLog`]. A module that held the log would hold the
append-error protocol with it — no fold mutation, no retry, no report from
memory, no cleanup, then the stable-prefix barrier — and there would be two
implementations of it, which is the duplication class this crate has already
paid for three times.

## `pub trait EventEmitter` › `fn emit(`

Emit one durable event, or fail.

**The hooks are a parameter, which is how every other funnel in this
tree takes them.** `WorkspaceManager::write_intent`, `add_worktree`,
`verify_worktree`, `remove_worktree`, `candidate_stage`,
`repair_materialize` and `EventLog::append_topology_hooked` all take
`hooks` per call rather than at construction, and an append is an
effect like any of them. Taking them at construction would also
conflict with the caller, which holds the same bundle for its own
effects and cannot lend it for an emitter's whole lifetime.

**What this does not do is force one bundle.** A caller may hand over a
different one, exactly as it may for any Git funnel, and the tree
already contains an instance: `scaffold::FoldedEmitter` keeps its own
`EventHooks`, because that one wraps the harness in a timeline recorder
the shared bundle's `events` family does not have. So appends made
through the scaffold are observable in the ordering timeline and appends
made through `emit::emit` are not — two observation surfaces for one
kind of event, decided by which emitter ran. That is a real divergence,
it is recorded in `reviews/FINDINGS.md`, and it is why this parameter is
not by itself a guarantee of anything: it makes the bundle the caller's
choice, and `every_family_of_the_harness_bundle_records_into_the_same_harness`
is the assertion that the choice was the right one.

### Errors

Whatever the emitter's append protocol returns, as an
[`super::emit::EmitFailure`] rather than an [`UpstrokeError`]. A caller
here never interprets it: an emit that failed means the fold is poisoned
and the coordinator is ending, and the effect that would have followed
this event must not run.

**It is not an `UpstrokeError` because obligation (3) may be
outstanding.** An entered append that fails leaves in-flight
invocations to cancel, and the ledger belongs to the driver, not to an
ordering module. The failure carries the obligation until it reaches
something that can discharge it; converting to `UpstrokeError` early
would drop it silently, which is the "remembered, not enforced" failure
this seam exists to make impossible.

## `pub enum DispatchKind {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
What a dispatch is
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub enum DispatchKind {`

Which of the two dispatches this is, and what each carries that the other
does not.

`decisions.admission_and_leases.leases.lifecycle`: "ordinary
`task_dispatched` creates the predicted lease (PR7) … a repair
`task_dispatched` records `InheritedLineage(root)`". The two are a sum
rather than a struct with two `Option`s because the fold refuses every
crossed combination — a predicted lease on a lineage member and an inherited
lease on an ordinary task are both `FoldError::MalformedEntry` — and a sum
makes the crossing unrepresentable instead of refused one layer later.

## `pub enum DispatchKind` › `Ordinary {`

An ordinary task, taking a predicted lease over the region its plan
hints imply.

## `pub enum DispatchKind` › `paths: PathSet`

The predicted region.

## `pub enum DispatchKind` › `Repair {`

A repair, executing inside its lineage's lease and materializing the
candidate that was rejected.

## `pub enum DispatchKind` › `root: TaskKey,`

The lineage root whose lease this generation executes inside.

## `pub enum DispatchKind` › `source: CandidateRef`

The protected candidate the worktree is materialized from.

## `impl DispatchKind` › `fn grant(&self) -> LeaseGrant {`

The grant `task_dispatched` records.

## `impl DispatchKind` › `fn source_candidate(&self) -> Option<CandidateRef> {`

The candidate `task_dispatched` records, for a repair.

## `impl DispatchKind` › `fn closing_disposition(&self) -> LeaseDisposition {`

What a settlement of this generation records about the lease.

Read off [`crate::topology::leases::GenerationLease::expected`]'s rule
rather than restated: a repair never changes a lineage lease, so every
one of its closures is `LineageHeld`, and an ordinary generation that
closes releases the region it held.

## `fn closing_disposition(&self) -> LeaseDisposition` › `self.lease().expected(false)`

**`GenerationLease::expected` is the whole of this rule**, and this
used to restate it: `Ordinary -> PredictedReleased`,
`Repair -> LineageHeld` is exactly what it computes from `Own` and
`InheritedLineage` when the generation does not survive. A second
match is a second authority for a value `check_lease_disposition`
refuses any other answer to, and the two would drift the moment the
vocabulary grew a third lease.

## `impl DispatchKind` › `const fn lease(&self) -> crate::topology::leases::GenerationLease {`

The lease relationship this dispatch establishes.

## `pub struct Dispatched {`

One dispatched generation: exactly `T-DISPATCH`'s `durable_state`.

"generation, base, worktree path, lease relationship, source candidate for
repairs" — and every field here is one of those five. The worktree path is
carried as the [`Slot`] it was derived from rather than as a bare
[`PathBuf`], so a later reclaim re-derives the path from the execution root
and the slot name instead of trusting a string a record could carry out of
the root. `worktree` is the path the add returned, kept for assertions and
for the `worktree_path` the event recorded.

## `pub struct Dispatched` › `pub key: TaskKey,`

The task.

## `pub struct Dispatched` › `pub generation: GenerationId,`

Its generation.

## `pub struct Dispatched` › `pub base: CommitSha,`

The commit the worktree was created at.

## `pub struct Dispatched` › `pub slot: Slot,`

The slot the worktree occupies.

## `pub struct Dispatched` › `pub worktree: PathBuf,`

The checkout, at the path `Worktree.Add` returned for it — the slot
target the funnel validated and handed to Git, not a reading of where
Git put it.

## `pub struct Dispatched` › `pub kind: DispatchKind,`

The lease relationship, and for a repair the candidate to materialize.

## `pub struct Dispatched` › `pub materialized: Option<Materialization>,`

What a repair's materialization observed — `Clean`, `Conflict` or
`Empty` — kept on the value so `attempt_started` records it before the
spawn. `None` for an ordinary dispatch.

## `impl Dispatched` › `pub fn quiescence(&self) -> Quiescence {`

The quiescence a reuse of this worktree is checked against.

[`Quiescence::AtBase`] and not [`Quiescence::HoldsTree`]: this generation
has no attempt and therefore no cumulative tree — `HoldsTree` is
`RetainedIdle`'s, and `settle.rs` owns that.

## `impl Dispatched` › `pub fn open_generation(&self) -> OpenGeneration {`

The narrower value the rebuild family takes.

One conversion, at the two call sites that hold a `Dispatched`, so the
rebuild path has a single parameter type and recovery does not need to
build a dispatch it cannot prove.

## `impl Dispatched` › `pub fn closing_disposition(&self) -> LeaseDisposition {`

What a settlement that **closes** this generation records about the
lease.

One reading of `GenerationLease::expected(false)` for both terminals
this slice appends — `generation_closed{RunEnding}` here and
`attempt_interrupted` in [`super::attempt`] — because the fold checks
both against the same rule and two call sites deciding it separately is
two chances to record `PredictedReleased` for a lineage member.

## `impl Dispatched` › `pub const fn source(&self) -> Option<&CandidateRef> {`

The candidate a repair materializes from.

## `pub struct OpenGeneration {`

What **rebuilding** an open generation needs, which is less than a dispatch.

[`Dispatched`] additionally carries the checkout path and the lease grant,
and no path below [`resume_open_no_attempt`] reads either: the rebuild
family asks the manager for `slot`, `base`, and — for a repair — the source
candidate, and nothing else.

**The narrowing is not tidiness, it is what lets recovery step (g) exist
without inventing a field.** A `Dispatched` reconstructed from the fold
would have to carry a `LeaseGrant`, whose predicted region the fold does not
hand back; a region invented at that call site is a field that lies about a
lease, and reaching into `src/topology/`'s lease table for the real one is
an edit to a frozen layer for a value the operation never reads. Asking for
what is used removes the question.

## `pub struct OpenGeneration` › `pub key: TaskKey,`

The task.

## `pub struct OpenGeneration` › `pub generation: GenerationId,`

Its generation.

## `pub struct OpenGeneration` › `pub base: CommitSha,`

The commit the worktree was created at, and is recreated at.

## `pub struct OpenGeneration` › `pub slot: Slot,`

The slot the worktree occupies.

## `pub struct OpenGeneration` › `pub source: Option<CandidateRef>,`

For a repair, the protected candidate the worktree is materialized
from. `None` for an ordinary generation.

## `impl OpenGeneration` › `pub fn quiescence(&self) -> Quiescence {`

The quiescence a reuse of this worktree is checked against.

[`Quiescence::AtBase`] and not [`Quiescence::HoldsTree`]: this
generation has no attempt and therefore no cumulative tree.
`HoldsTree` is `RetainedIdle`'s, and `settle.rs` owns that.

## `pub fn task_slot(key: TaskKey, generation: GenerationId) -> Slot {`

The slot one generation of one task occupies.

`decisions.workspace_candidates.manager`: "detached linked worktrees with
durable synced intents (`tasks/k<key>-g<gen>`, `merge/s<seq>`)". Derived
here rather than at each call site so no two callers can disagree about
which worktree a generation owns.

## `pub fn dispatch(`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
O21 — the fresh dispatch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub fn dispatch(`

**O21.** Append `task_dispatched`, then write the intent, then add the
worktree — and for a repair, materialize its source into it.

The provisional reservation is *not* taken here. `permits.
provisional_reservations` puts it at "a selection decision", which is
`select.rs`'s, and has it "converted at the append" — so the conversion is
the caller's statement that this append happened, made with the same
`(key, kind)` it reserved under. Doing it inside would let a dispatch
convert a reservation nothing took.

There is **no `Worktree.Verify` in this function**, and that is O22 rather
than an omission: `Verify` guards reuse. See the module docs.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when a repair's source candidate is not an object
this repository has — `T-DISPATCH`'s `refusal_condition`, and it is checked
*before* the append so the refusal costs no durable state. The containment
refusals of [`WorkspaceManager`] (a worktree path outside the execution root
or on a reparse point) are the other half of that condition and are raised by
the funnels themselves. Otherwise: whatever the emitter or a Git funnel
returns.

## `manager.revalidate()?;`

Before the append, because a refusal after it would leave an open
generation whose worktree can never be built. `T-DISPATCH` lists "source
candidate object missing" beside the containment refusals, so both are
here and both are ahead of the event.

The containment half needs this call to be true of it at all.
`execution_root` says "every create/reclaim/delete revalidates", and
`write_intent` and `add_worktree` each do — but that is *after* this
function has appended, so without the line below the sentence above
would be a claim about the two effects rather than about the dispatch.
The three conditions are filesystem facts about the world and not about
this request: a foreign worktree created inside the execution root, a
reparse point planted on the chain, or a managed base that stopped being
a real directory can each start being true between `run_started` and
this call. It costs one read-only `git worktree list`; what it buys is
that the `OpenNoAttempt` generation this event opens is never one whose
worktree the very next line refuses to build — which is exactly what
hoisting `refuse_absent_source` above the append avoids for the other
half of the same `refusal_condition`.

## `emitter.emit(`

(1) The event. First, and by itself.

## `worktree_path: worktree.to_string_lossy().into_owned(),`

The string a later process compares and re-derives. A platform
path type here would make a log written on one operating system a
question on another — `TaskDispatched::worktree_path` says so.

## `let mut dispatched = Dispatched {`

(2) The intent, synced. (3) The add, which refuses without it.

## `dispatched.worktree = create_worktree(manager, hooks, &dispatched.open_generation())?;`

The add's own answer replaces the derivation, and what that buys is
narrow enough to be worth stating exactly. Until this line the field and
the event's `worktree_path` were one local under two names, so a test
comparing them compared a value to itself and could only fail on a lossy
conversion. Now the event's string is the pre-append derivation — O21
puts the append first, so it can be nothing else — and the field is what
`Worktree.Add` returned, which is the target the funnel validated and
handed to `git worktree add`.

So their agreement says the durable event names the directory the add was
told to create. It is **not** an observation of where Git put the
checkout: `WorkspaceManager::add_worktree` answers with `slot_target`,
which is the same `slot_path` rule the string above came from, and
nothing reads the location back. A second, independent provenance would
have to come from `git worktree list`; it is owed, not claimed here.

## `if dispatched.source().is_some() {`

(4) A repair's materialization, which `ObjectSite::RepairMaterialize`
itself places `Adjacent::After(DurableEvent::TaskDispatched)`. What it
observed rides on the value for the attempt to record.

## `pub struct DispatchRequest {`

What a caller asks [`dispatch`] for.

A struct rather than four parameters because three of them are identities
that must agree with one another and with the reservation the caller
converts; a positional call that transposed key and generation would type-
check under two newtypes over `u32` if either lost its wrapper.

## `pub struct DispatchRequest` › `pub key: TaskKey,`

The task being dispatched.

## `pub struct DispatchRequest` › `pub generation: GenerationId,`

The generation this opens. Dense per task: the fold refuses any other.

## `pub struct DispatchRequest` › `pub base: CommitSha,`

The commit the worktree is created at.

## `pub struct DispatchRequest` › `pub kind: DispatchKind,`

Ordinary or repair.

## `fn create_worktree(`

Intent then add, which is the only order [`WorkspaceManager::add_worktree`]
permits.

`Refusal::AddWithoutIntent` enforces it at the add site, so this order is
checked rather than merely intended — an add whose intent is not already
durable creates a worktree `reclaim_intents` can never find.

The path returned is the funnel's answer rather than a derivation made
beside it, so a caller that records the checkout's path has one source for
it. That source is [`WorkspaceManager::add_worktree`], whose answer is the
validated slot target it gave `git worktree add` — where the checkout was
*asked* to go. Nothing here reads back where Git put it.

## `fn refuse_absent_source(`

Refuse a repair whose protected source is not in this repository.

Two conditions, because the packet's "source candidate object missing" can
arrive either way and only one of them is about the object: the authoritative
ref `refs/upstroke/runs/<id>/candidates/<key>/<gen>` is what keeps the commit
reachable (R11, "never pruned while the run can resume"), so a ref that is
gone or that names a different commit is the same failure as an object that
was never written, and both would leave `git cherry-pick` to fail with a
message about a revision rather than about a lost candidate.

## `pub enum Reuse {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
O22 — reuse, and only reuse, is gated by Verify
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub enum Reuse {`

What [`verify_or_recreate`] did.

## `pub enum Reuse` › `Verified,`

The recorded worktree passed `Worktree.Verify` and is reused as it
stands.

## `pub enum Reuse` › `Recreated {`

It did not, and was removed with force and rebuilt. Carries the failure
so a caller — and a test — can say *why* it was not reusable, rather
than only that it was not.

## `pub enum Reuse` › `failure: VerifyFailure`

What `Worktree.Verify` refused it for.

## `impl Reuse` › `pub const fn reused(&self) -> bool {`

Whether the worktree that came back is the one that was there.

## `pub fn verify_or_recreate(`

**O22.** `Worktree.Verify` the recorded worktree, or remove it with force
and recreate it (intent then add).

`T-DISPATCH`'s `resume_action`, word for word: "verify the worktree at the
recorded base with Worktree.Verify (linked worktree at the recorded path,
HEAD == base, index unlocked, no cherry-pick/merge/sequencer state) or remove
it with force and recreate it (intent then add)". Every one of those four
conditions is [`WorkspaceManager::verify_worktree`]'s, not restated here —
a second copy of a predicate is a second thing to keep in step, and this one
is `VerifyFailure`'s whole vocabulary.

### The quiescence is the caller's, not this function's

`Quiescence` has two forms and the packet gives both in one breath: "HEAD
equals the recorded base (**or, for RetainedIdle, the worktree holds the
retained cumulative tree**)". Which one applies is a property of the
generation's *class*, which lives in the fold — so it is a parameter here
rather than something derived from [`Dispatched`], which knows only that a
generation was opened. [`Dispatched::quiescence`] is the `OpenNoAttempt`
answer and is what [`resume_open_no_attempt`] passes.

[`Quiescence::HoldsTree`] does **not** belong to this function, and that is
not a matter of taste: it is `RetainedIdle`'s form of the check, and a
retained generation is closed rather than recreated (INV-06). No retained
worktree reaches this module at all — [`super::settle::retry`] performs the
retained `Worktree.Verify` through its own `WorktreeVerify` seam and writes
the closure itself — so nothing here has one to hand the recreate branch.

### The intent is re-written rather than removed and re-written

The reclaim order elsewhere is *worktree then intent*, because an intent that
outlives its worktree is reclaimed harmlessly while a worktree that outlives
its intent is a leak nothing can find. That reasoning applies here too, so
the sequence is: force-remove the worktree, re-write the (idempotent) intent,
add. At no instant does a worktree exist without a durable intent naming it.

### Errors

The containment refusals, or a Git or I/O error. A worktree that merely fails
its quiescence check is `Ok(Reuse::Recreated { .. })` — that is a decision,
not a failure.

## `pub fn verify_reuse(`

**O22's observation, with no branch on it.** `Worktree.Verify` the recorded
worktree and report what it saw.

`decisions.workspace_candidates.generation` gives the failure two different
recoveries, and which one applies is a property of the generation's class,
not of the observation: "failing verification an OpenNoAttempt or repair
worktree is removed with force and recreated, and a **RetainedIdle
generation is closed** with `generation_closed{WorktreeMissing}`". INV-06
states the same thing as a prohibition — a retained generation "is never
recreated" — because what its worktree holds is a cumulative tree that no
base can be re-cut into, so a forced removal there destroys work
irrecoverably rather than costing a rebuild.

So the observation is one function and the recovery is the caller's.
[`verify_or_recreate`] is the rebuilding half and is for the two classes
that may be rebuilt. The retained class's recovery is
[`super::settle::retry`]'s and there is exactly one of it — it reaches
`Worktree.Verify` through its own `WorktreeVerify` seam rather than through
this function, so a retained worktree never arrives here to be handed the
recreate branch.

That leaves this function with one caller today, and it stays a separate
function rather than being folded back into [`verify_or_recreate`] because
what it separates is the *branch*, not the caller: the observation and the
destructive recovery are named apart, so a future retained-class reader in
this module has something to take that has no `remove_worktree` beyond it.

### Errors

The containment refusals, or a Git error. A worktree that merely fails its
quiescence check is `Ok(Err(VerifyFailure))` — that is an observation, not a
failure.

## `pub fn materialize_repair(`

Run, or re-run, a repair's recorded materialization in a verified or fresh
worktree, and say what it observed.

`Object.RepairMaterialize` restores the worktree's index and checkout to
`HEAD`'s tree (`git read-tree --reset -u HEAD`), then runs
`git cherry-pick --no-commit`, whose merge objects are referenced by the
worktree index (R9), and removes the state files the pick leaves
(`MERGE_MSG`, `AUTO_MERGE`) so the worktree is quiescent again. It is
idempotent in a worktree at the recorded base **because of the restore**: a
fresh worktree and one whose index already holds a completed pick both get
one pick onto the base's tree. A pick onto the merged index is not a no-op
— it is a three-way merge, and PR #249's crash review measured it applying
its hunk again on every resume
(`a_continuation_after_a_completed_pick_hands_the_worker_the_tree_one_pick_produces`)
— which is why `T-DISPATCH`'s "re-run the recorded materialization in a
**verified or fresh** worktree" needs the funnel to start from the base
whatever the verify found, and why a caller reaches this through
[`resume_open_no_attempt`] rather than directly. The observation is the
funnel's `Materialized`, mapped one-to-one onto the wire's
`Materialization` by [`observed_kind`].

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] for an ordinary dispatch, which has no
materialization to reproduce and whose caller has therefore lost track of
which kind it holds. Otherwise the containment refusals or a Git error.

## `pub fn resume_open_no_attempt(`

The whole of `T-DISPATCH`'s resume action for a live process, in order.

Verify-or-recreate first, then — for a repair — the materialization, because
the materialization is what has to land in a worktree that is already known
good. Measured on git 2.43 (`--no-commit` leaves no `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD`): a
kill inside the pick leaves one of five states — nothing, `index.lock`, the
merged index with no state file, the merged index with `MERGE_MSG.lock`
held, the merged index with `MERGE_MSG`. The two lock forms and `MERGE_MSG`
are what `Worktree.Verify` reads and recreates from. The merged index with
no state file — the index published and unlocked, the process dead before
`MERGE_MSG.lock` — is indistinguishable from a pick that completed, whose
state files the funnel cleared: neither leaves anything the verify reads,
so the worktree is reused as it stands (`Reuse::Verified`) and the funnel
restores the base's tree before it picks again, reporting the same
observation
(`a_materialization_killed_after_its_index_write_converges_from_both_of_its_states`,
for the clean and the conflicting source). Either way the result is one
pick onto the base's tree in a worktree at the recorded base, and
[`Resumed`] carries both what the verify decided and what the
materialization observed. (This note once listed only the residue-bearing
states for a kill inside the pick; PR #249's fourth-round record review
found the copy.)

### Errors

As [`verify_or_recreate`] and [`materialize_repair`].

## `pub fn close_at_run_end(`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run end
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub fn close_at_run_end(`

Close an `OpenNoAttempt` generation at run end and scrub its worktree.

`decisions.workspace_candidates.generation`: "a generation with no attempt
started is recreated at its recorded base during a live run and **closed at
run end**", and `cleanup`: "RetainedIdle and OpenNoAttempt worktrees are
resumably_open during a live run and closed at run end".

The event precedes the scrub, and that is `cleanup`'s own rule — "task
worktree scrubbed only after `task_candidate_created` is durable **or the
generation is Closed**". A scrub before the close would remove a worktree the
log still says is resumably open, which is the state a resume would then try
to verify.

### Errors

Whatever the emitter returns, or a Git or I/O error from the scrub. The scrub
runs only if the append succeeded, for the reason above.

## `pub(super) fn scrub(`

Forced removal of a worktree and then its intent.

`cleanup`: "every worktree, staging, and snapshot removal is forced … so Git
administrative residue left by an interrupted command … never blocks
reclaim". Worktree first, then intent, so that the durable record naming the
worktree outlives the worktree rather than the other way round.

## `const fn observed_kind(observed: Materialized) -> Materialization {`

The funnel's observation as the wire records it. The funnel's three
variants are matched exhaustively, so a fourth funnel outcome is a compile
error here; the wire's `Materialization` already has a fourth, `Retained`,
which a same-generation retry records and no materialization ever observes,
and a fifth on that side would not fail this match — the record's Class A
inventory is what says the two enums correspond. (This note once claimed the
guard both ways; PR #249's fourth-round record review read the enums.)

## `pub struct Resumed {`

What [`resume_open_no_attempt`] did: whether the worktree was reused or
recreated, and — for a repair — what the materialization observed, which
is what the continuation's `attempt_started` records.
