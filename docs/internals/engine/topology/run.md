## Module

`TopologyRun` — the driver `decisions.sequential_substrate` names twice.

`engine`: "`src/engine/topology.rs` TopologyRun drives schema 4 at
max_parallel = 1 synchronously; every path exists here before Tokio".
`selection`: "schemas 1-3 always run the legacy engine; **schema 4 always
runs TopologyRun**".

### Why this module was missing, and what that cost

For the whole of PR7's implementation and two review rounds there was no
such type. `create_run`, `run_recovery_order`, `select`, `dispatch` and
`close_at_run_end` were each reachable **only from their own tests**, and
nothing outside `select.rs` so much as matched on a [`Step`]. Every
component of the run was built and tested; no caller sequenced them.

Nothing in the project could see it. All 117 named tests passed, every gate
was green on three platforms, and a per-lane review reads the lanes that
exist. A mutation catalogue measures whether existing code is pinned, and
**omission has nothing to mutate.** It was found by asking *which command
runs this?* rather than *does this pass?*

Measured afterwards: of 265 withheld-catalogue entries authored from the
packet alone by readers forbidden to open this directory, **93 — 35% — are
written against this module**, naming methods like `run_fresh` and
`initialize_slots`. Six independent readers all assumed the driver existed,
because the specification describes one.

### So the loop's branches are a type

`loop` is an ordered enumeration exactly like `recovery_order`, and it fails
the same way. [`LoopBranch`] transcribes it, [`LoopBranch::disposition`]
says of each branch whether this build performs it, refuses it, or has **not
yet implemented** it — and that third answer is deliberately in the type
rather than in a comment. A branch nobody has written and a branch nobody
has *named* are the same thing to every instrument here; naming it is the
whole difference between debt and an omission.

## `pub struct RunEmitter<'a> {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The production emitter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub struct RunEmitter<'a> {`

The one emitter a run's appends go through.

**Before this, `EventEmitter` had a single implementation in the whole tree
and it was `#[cfg(test)]`.** Same root cause as the missing driver: the seam
was written for a caller nobody built. And that test emitter re-implements
the append — round-trip, `plan_transition`, append, `apply_delta` — rather
than calling [`emit`], so it **does not run the append-error protocol's five
obligations**: no explicit poison, no reservation cancellation, no
in-flight invocation cancellation, no reopen, and no
present/absent/undetermined report. Every dispatch, attempt, settle and
candidate test drives through it, which is why the protocol's coverage over
the pipeline is thinner than the suite's size suggests.

This type exists so the production path does not inherit that. It is a
forwarder and deliberately nothing else — there is **one** implementation of
the protocol and it is [`emit`]. A slice whose dominant finding class is
duplication does not get a second one.

## `pub struct RunEmitter<'a>` › `pub identity: &'a RunIdentity,`

What every refusal names, and what the checked replay is derived
against.

## `pub struct RunEmitter<'a>` › `pub state: EmitState<'a>,`

The fold, the append handle, the two ledgers, and the warnings — the
five things one append touches.

## `pub struct RunEmitter<'a>` › `pub clock: &'a dyn TimeSource,`

Where the event's timestamp comes from.

## `impl EventEmitter for RunEmitter<'_>` › `fn emit(`

[`emit`], and nothing before or after it.

The event it returns is discarded because no caller of this trait has
ever wanted it: what a caller needs to know is whether the effect that
follows the append may run, and that is the `Result`. `emit` itself
hands the round-tripped event to `plan_transition`, so the value has
already done its work by the time it reaches here.

### Errors

Whatever [`emit`] returns, converted at the boundary. Every variant
means the same thing to a caller — the following effect must not run —
and they differ only in whether the log was touched, which
`EmitError::wrote_nothing` answers for a reader that cares.

## `struct RunJournal<'a, 'h> {`

The run's [`CandidateJournal`], for the candidate sequence's own appends.

The sequence takes a journal rather than an [`EventEmitter`] because
`candidate.rs` needs to *read* the fold between its appends — the typestate
carries a candidate from commit to pin to prepared, and each step checks the
generation class it is transitioning from. So the journal is an emitter and
a fold reader together.

**Before this, `CandidateJournal` had one implementation and it was
`#[cfg(test)]`** — and that one re-implements the append rather than calling
[`emit`], so it runs none of the append-error protocol's five obligations.
The whole candidate sequence was therefore tested against an emitter no
production path would use, which is the same hole `RunEmitter` was written
to close for dispatch and attempt.

## `fn emit(&mut self, body: TopologyEventBody) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {` › `self.emitter`

Three disjoint field borrows, and the discharge of obligation (3)
happens here because this struct is what holds the ledger.

## `pub enum LoopBranch {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The loop's branches, as the packet names them
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub enum LoopBranch {`

One branch of `decisions.sequential_substrate.loop`, in its order.

## `pub enum LoopBranch` › `IngestAnswers,`

"after recovery: ingest answers (never after `budget_exceeded` or a
halting settlement in this epoch)". Before selection, not a [`Step`].

## `pub enum LoopBranch` › `Integration,`

"if an eligible integration exists: check the ceiling … then take a
provisional integration reservation and integrate exactly one".

## `pub enum LoopBranch` › `ReadyRetry,`

"else if a `ready_retry` task exists: ceiling check, provisional
{pipeline} reservation, next attempt in the retained generation".

## `pub enum LoopBranch` › `ReadyDispatch,`

"else if a ready task exists: ceiling check, provisional dispatch
reservation, dispatch, run one attempt through the Runner and settle".

## `pub enum LoopBranch` › `DeferBackoff,`

"else if any Deferred task or verification-deferred candidate exists …
sleep the defer backoff and append `defer_wait_elapsed`".

## `pub enum LoopBranch` › `HardBlock,`

"else apply the hard-block rules (attached-terminal prompt or
`wait_on_block` for open questions)".

## `pub enum LoopBranch` › `Closure,`

"else run-end closure, `derived_outcome`, `run_finished`, terminal
finalization per `run_end_policy`".

## `pub enum Disposition {`

What this build does with a branch.

## `pub enum Disposition` › `Performed,`

Implemented and performed.

## `pub enum Disposition` › `RefusedByCheckpoint,`

Refused before any append, by a live clause naming this build.

## `pub enum Disposition` › `NotYetImplemented,`

**Not written yet.** Carried in the type so it cannot become the kind of
omission this module exists because of.

## `pub enum Disposition` › `NotThisSlice {`

**Another slice's, by contract.** Distinct from
[`Self::RefusedByCheckpoint`], and the distinction is not pedantry:
`checkpoint_refusals` authorises this build to refuse exactly one thing
— run end beyond refusal — and a second refusal wearing that name would
be a build refusing something the packet never let it refuse. It is not
[`Self::NotYetImplemented`] either, because that is debt this slice owes
and this is not.

**No arm returns it today.** `IngestAnswers` carried it while answers
were PR9's; PR9 ingests every origin's answer, so that arm is
`Performed` and `every_branch_states_what_this_build_does_with_it`
asserts the set of `NotThisSlice` branches empty. The variant stays,
`#[allow(dead_code)]`, for the next branch that sits on a slice
boundary.

## `pub enum Disposition` › `slice: &'static str,`

Which slice owns it.

## `pub enum Disposition` › `citation: &'static str,`

The contract passage that says so.

## `pub enum Disposition` › `PartlyImplemented {`

Partly written, with both halves named **in the branch's own words**.

`loop` states each branch as a sequence of clauses, and a branch can be
honestly half-built. The ready-dispatch branch was, until its attempt and
settlement landed: its first three clauses were a reservation and a
dispatch, its last an entire attempt through the Runner, and only the
first three were written. Collapsing that into `Performed` would have
claimed work nobody did, and into `NotYetImplemented` would have hidden a
production append that genuinely happens. Neither was true, so the type
said both.

**No branch is `PartlyImplemented` today** — every arm of
[`LoopBranch::disposition`] is `Performed`, `RefusedByCheckpoint` or
`NotThisSlice`, and
`a_refusal_names_the_branch_and_says_whether_anything_happened` asserts
it. The variant stays for the next branch built in halves.

## `pub enum Disposition` › `#[allow(dead_code)]` (trailing)

never called at 610106b; see `PR7-NARROWED-SURFACE-19-UNCALLED` (§2)

## `pub enum Disposition` › `performs: &'static str,`

The clauses this build performs.

## `pub enum Disposition` › `owes: &'static str,`

The clauses it refuses by name, having performed the ones above.

## `impl LoopBranch` › `pub const ALL: [Self; 7] = [`

The seven branches, in the packet's order.

Transcribed from `decisions.sequential_substrate.loop`. The order of
this array **is** the claim; a test compares behaviour against it rather
than against a second list written from the implementation.

## `impl LoopBranch` › `pub const fn label(self) -> &'static str {`

A short name for the branch, for a refusal message and a test.

## `impl LoopBranch` › `pub const fn disposition(self) -> Disposition {`

What this build does with it, and — for anything but `Performed` — the
reason belongs in the arm, not in prose somewhere else.

## `pub const fn disposition(self) -> Disposition` › `Self::Closure => Disposition::Performed,`

Performed since PR10. `checkpoint_refusals` — "an intermediate build refuses,
before any append, any operation whose terminals it does not implement" —
named run end beyond refusal as PR9's one refusal, and `Admitted` carried no
value that could name a closure. It carries one now: `Admitted::Closure`
crosses the checkpoint and [`TopologyRun::close_run`] performs the closure
procedure at `max_parallel = 1` (`closure.md`), appends `run_finished`, and
finalizes (`finalize.md`). What does not cross is `Poisoned` (the absence of
a branch), `NotStarted` (an unstarted fold admits nothing) and `Finished` (a
finished run is refused continuation after its finalization). The
concurrent half of closure — in-flight cancellation, the budget drain,
promotion and publication completion inside closure — is refused by
`closure::refuse_unclosable` naming PR11.

## `pub const fn disposition(self) -> Disposition` › `Self::Integration => Disposition::Performed,`

"check the ceiling … then take a provisional integration reservation
and integrate exactly one", whole: the ceiling is `select`'s, the
`{pipeline, merge}` reservation is taken in `integrate` before any
effect, and the sequence itself — the exact-base decision under
`assert_publishable`, the fast `merge_prepared`, the compare-and-swap
and `task_merged` — is `super::integrate`'s, appending through the
same `RunJournal` the candidate sequence uses. A pre-append failure
cancels the reservation and leaves the candidate queued; a failure
after the first append leaves the fold-derived holding the append
created, which recovery resolves — an unresolved verification included:
its reservation converted at `merge_verification_started`, the open
transaction is what holds the pipeline entitlement from then on, and the
`Err` arm's cancellation is not reached (the review of `79ddbffb`
measured the reservation ledger at 0 there and read it as a release;
`pr8-triage.md` §6 finding 5).

## `pub const fn disposition(self) -> Disposition` › `Self::DeferBackoff => Disposition::Performed,`

`Deferral::wait` sleeps the backoff and returns the event;
`TopologyRun::step` appends it. In that order — the event records
a wait that *elapsed*, so appending it first would put a claim in
the log a kill during the sleep would make false.

## `pub const fn disposition(self) -> Disposition` › `Self::ReadyDispatch => Disposition::Performed,`

The branch reads "ceiling check, provisional dispatch
reservation, dispatch, run one attempt through the Runner and
settle". All four clauses, and every case of the last one: a
success through the candidate sequence, a retry, an escalation,
an outage deferral, a park, and a terminal failure. The last two
were refusals until `TaskFold::defers` and the question builder
existed, and both refusals went with their causes.

## `pub const fn disposition(self) -> Disposition` › `Self::ReadyRetry => Disposition::Performed,`

"{pipeline} reservation, next attempt in the retained
generation", whole: the reservation, `Worktree.Verify`, the
retry's `attempt_started`, the attempt itself and its
settlement. The attempt half is the ready-dispatch branch's
machinery, reached through the same `attempt` and `settle`.

## `pub const fn disposition(self) -> Disposition` › `Self::HardBlock => Disposition::Performed,`

`loop`'s "attached-terminal prompt or `wait_on_block` for open
questions". The channel decision is `interaction::answers_for`'s;
this branch asks whatever source it is handed. An answer to a
**verification-park** question is ingested here — PR8's
`question_answered`, which the fold routes to `AwaitingMerge` for an
answer and to a failed lineage for a decline — and, since PR9, an
answer to a repair-admission or attempt park too. Every origin goes
through `answer_for`: for a `HumanBinding` admission the answer must
name a frozen option and carries the one-off binding derived from it
(E2), any other origin records its option index, and a decline halts
or not by the run's seam. The `QuestionOrigin` the fold recorded
decides whether an override is derived, not whether the answer is
ingested.

## `pub const fn disposition(self) -> Disposition` › `Self::IngestAnswers => Disposition::Performed,`

**Performed since PR9**, which owns `question_answered`, `T-ANSWER`
and "AwaitingInput (limit | human_binding) -> Pending via validated
answer". Two readers of one path: `step` polls every open question
through the non-blocking `AnswerSource::poll` before it selects, so an
answer left in the run directory while the engine was away is ingested
ahead of any other branch; the hard block resolves (blocking) when
nothing else can move. Both go through `answer_for` and
`ingest_answer`, so what an answer means is decided once.

## `impl LoopBranch` › `pub const fn of(step: &Step) -> Option<Self> {`

The branch a selected [`Step`] belongs to.

One mapping, so "which branch is this" is never re-derived at a second
site — the two-rules-that-can-disagree shape this slice has paid for
repeatedly.

## `pub const fn of(step: &Step) -> Option<Self>` › `Step::Poisoned => None,`

Not a branch of the loop: the append-error protocol has already
ended the command. `select` returns it so that a poisoned fold
cannot be read as "no further transition, therefore end the run".

## `pub const fn of(step: &Step) -> Option<Self>` › `Step::Dispatch { .. } | Step::RepairDispatch { .. } => Some(Self::ReadyDispatch),`

A repair dispatch is the ready-dispatch branch reaching a Repair-origin
task: `eligibility_order` names "new ordinary dispatch" and no branch
for repairs, so the step maps to that branch, and the branch performs
it. `dispatch_kind` derives `Repair { root, source }` from the registry
entry's lineage and the `merge_rejected` that registered it, `dispatch`
materializes the source in the same call, and `attempt_started` records
what the materialization observed.

## `pub const fn of(step: &Step) -> Option<Self>` › `Step::BudgetExceeded(_) => None,`

A breach is recorded *by* the branch that asked, and every
asking branch is an admitting one; the ceiling is never consulted
outside one.

## `impl IntegrationJournal for IntegrationCx<'_, '_>` › `fn converted(&mut self, key: TaskKey) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {`

The provisional integration reservation converts at the sequence's
first append, and the ledger it converts in is the one `EmitState`
borrows for the append-error protocol's cancellation — so the journal
forwards to it rather than the sequence holding a second borrow.

## `fn implementer_binding(`

The binding the candidate ran under, for `passes_for`'s self-review rule:
the task's validated override when one exists (E2 binds every later attempt
to it), else the frozen rung at the fold-derived rung position. The fold
moves a task's rung only at an escalation settlement and a task at
`AwaitingMerge` settles no further attempt, so that position is the
producing attempt's. The reviews of `3414dc58` found the ladder's *last*
rung passed here, which a candidate produced lower down never ran under —
so a primary reviewer equal to the real implementer was not swapped for
the alternative, and a model could be handed its own work to review
(`pr8-triage.md` C6). `DESIGN.md` §26 verdict item 4 reruns "all recorded
gates and review passes", and the recorded passes were selected against this
binding.

## `impl IntegrationCx<'_, '_>` › `fn judge_proposal(&mut self, request: &VerifyRequest<'_>) -> Result<Judgement, JudgeError> {`

The verification proper, every error typed so [`Verification::verify`]
can decide what each one means: the review diff, the plan, the input
classification, the review inputs, and the judge.

The input classification is `classify::unjudgeable_diff` — a review diff
no reviewer can judge (too large, opaque) — and the review-input policy's
answer for the proposed tree, read in the staging worktree. Either stands
in for the gates and reviewers as the judge's prior failure, and the
sequence parks the candidate `HumanRequired` (R4). Without it the real
refusal escaped from `review::materialize_prompt` as an error, and a policy
that refused the tree still published (`pr8-triage.md`, tests 2). The
attempt path's `diff_failure` also checks a Test task's provenance; that
is a judgement of the candidate when it was produced, and the reviews of
`916852c9` reproduced it rejecting a Test candidate whose identical test
another candidate had published first, so the integration diff is not
asked it (`pr8-triage.md` §5, adequacy 2).

## `impl Verification for IntegrationCx<'_, '_>` › `self.spend.record_reviews(key, &judgement.reviews);`

The ceiling's ledger, charged before the terminal is appended, exactly as
an attempt's reviews are charged in `settle`; `Spend::replay` rebuilds it
from the terminal's record. All three record-carrying terminals do carry
one: `merge_prepared` and `merge_rejected` inside their verification
record, and `merge_verification_unavailable` in its own `reviews`, so a
review that ended in a park or an outage is charged live *and* on replay
(`PR8-R2-SPEND-REPLAY`; `pr8-plan.md` R22 is superseded).

## `impl Verification for IntegrationCx<'_, '_>` › `Err(JudgeError::Runner(error)) => match error.fate {`

What a Runner error means is what the Runner established about the
process. `NeverStarted` is `invariants[INV-23]`'s mid-run
`RunnerSpawnFailure`: an observed infrastructure failure with a terminal
of its own (`transaction_fault_matrix[T-VERIFY].resume_action`); left to
`?` at `3414dc58`, it escaped after `merge_verification_started`, the
transaction stayed open, and every repeat bypassed the defer and park
limit (`pr8-triage.md` C3). `Gone` — a gate process that started and the
Runner has since established gone — is an outage too, `Other` because it
is not a spawn failure. `Unresolved` is neither: the repair round settled
it as a spawn failure, and the reviews of `916852c9` reproduced a gate
still running in Docker beside a `Deferred` terminal that had released
both entitlements and removed the snapshot the container had mounted, then
a second sequence started beside it. A terminal authorizes cleanup and
readmission, so an error that leaves the process's liveness unknown ends
the command with the transaction open and nothing appended; the next
resume's census reclaims the container before recovery step (f) settles
the verification interrupted. A reviewer's Runner error reaches the
judgement through `run_review`, which reports it unavailable on the same
two fates and propagates the third.

## `impl Verification for IntegrationCx<'_, '_>` › `Err(JudgeError::Other(UpstrokeError::Git { message })) => Ok(Verified::Unavailable {`

Foreign Git state observed by the verification — a corrupt staging index
under the review-input reader, a proposal whose object cannot be read, a
snapshot the checkout could not make — is among the failures
`decisions.repairs.not_repairs` says "at integration terminate in
merge_verification_unavailable with outcome Deferred or Parked". Every
Git command the verification issues runs before or between its processes,
never beside one, so the terminal is safe to settle. R24 at `916852c9`
excluded these and the `?` propagated them as an interruption
(`pr8-triage.md` §5, record F3).

## `impl LoopBranch` › `pub fn owes(self, clause: &str) -> UpstrokeError {`

The refusal a branch returns for one clause it does not implement.

Distinct from [`Self::unimplemented`], which speaks for the whole
branch. This one names a single clause, so a branch that performs most
of itself can still refuse a case precisely — and the message says which
case rather than which branch, because "ready dispatch is not
implemented" would be false by the time this is reached.

### Errors

Always [`UpstrokeError::Refused`].

## `impl LoopBranch` › `#[allow(dead_code)]` (trailing)

never called at 610106b; see `PR7-NARROWED-SURFACE-19-UNCALLED` (§2)

## `impl LoopBranch` › `pub fn unimplemented(self) -> UpstrokeError {`

The refusal a not-yet-implemented branch returns.

### Errors

Always [`UpstrokeError::Refused`]; the value exists so the message is
written once.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a> {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The run
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a> {`

The seams one iteration of the loop needs, and nothing it owns.

Separate from [`TopologyRun`] because these are the *caller's* — a clock, a
sleeper, the hook bundle — while the run owns the fold, the log, the
ledgers and the locks. A driver that owned its clock could not be driven
deterministically by a test, which is the whole of what "with seams from the
start" means here.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub manager: &'a WorkspaceManager,`

The execution root and its Git funnels. Every effect of the loop that is
not an append goes through it.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub clock: &'a dyn TimeSource,`

Where a durable event's timestamp comes from.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub sleeper: &'a dyn Sleeper,`

What the defer backoff sleeps on.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub runner: &'a dyn crate::runner::Runner,`

The boundary every process of this run crosses.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub adapters: &'a dyn crate::agent::AdapterSource,`

Where an agent name becomes an adapter.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub paths: &'a crate::rundir::RunPaths,`

The run's directories.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub plans: &'a dyn AttemptPlans,`

Where an attempt's plan and its review inputs are assembled. A seam
because building the worker's command materializes the permissions file
that defines the sandbox, and because a plan needs the run's config —
neither of which is in the log the fold replays.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub reviews: &'a dyn ReviewPasses,`

Where a review pass is executed. `review::run_review`, behind its seam.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub input_policy: &'a dyn ReviewInputPolicy,`

Whether the staged evidence is reviewable. `Workspace`'s policy, behind
its seam.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub answers: &'a dyn crate::interaction::AnswerSource,`

Where an answer comes from at a hard block: a terminal prompt or a
`wait_on_block` wait, decided by `interaction::answers_for` and not
here.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub ids: &'a dyn IdSource,`

Where a question's id comes from. A seam because a ULID minted inline
would append different bytes every run, and a park's whole point is
that the id survives to the resume that rematerializes it.

## `pub struct RunSeams<'a>` › `pub halts_run: bool,`

`decisions.run_end_policy`: whether a task's terminal failure halts the
run. Run configuration rather than an injection point, and here because
the settlement records it and the log is the only place it survives.

## `struct RunAs {`

Which attempt of which rung this is, and whether it has already been
announced.

The difference between the two branches that run an attempt. A dispatch is
**attempt one of its generation**, at the rung the log records, carrying the
task's accumulated brief, with nothing to resume, and it appends
`attempt_started` itself; a retry is the generation's next attempt, may
resume a session, and was already announced by `settle::retry` after the
worktree verified.

**Attempt one of its generation, not of a *fresh* one**, and the distinction
is the third false half of this comment rather than pedantry. `step`'s
`Admitted::Dispatch` arm builds one `RunAs` for both of its paths —
`dispatch_ready` when `continuing` is false and `continue_open` when it is
true — and the continuation runs over the `OpenNoAttempt` generation a
**prior process** opened with `task_dispatched` and recovery step (g)
recreated the worktree for. `Step::Dispatch`'s own doc says so in as many
words: "It is the same branch reaching the same attempt over ground that
already exists."

`Self::FIRST_ATTEMPT` is still right for it, and the corrected sentence is
what leaves a reader a reason to check that: `OpenNoAttempt` means the
generation exists and **no attempt has started in it**, so the continuation's
attempt is its first. A reader who believed "fresh generation" would conclude
the continuation never reaches this constructor and stop looking.
`PR7-R4-LOOP-005`, S5 round 4.

**This sentence said "always attempt one on rung zero" with an empty brief,
and both halves were falsified by the repairs that made them false.** The
rung half by `6d3fc6f`, which made this arm read `ladder_position` and added
a test asserting it dispatches at rung 1; the brief half by `136fcdb`, whose
commit message **quotes this exact sentence as false** and then left it
standing. `PR7-R3-RUNAS-DOC-FALSIFIED-BY-ITS-OWN-REPAIR`, and a doc class
sub-shape no insertion detector can see, because nothing moved.

## `struct RunAs` › `feedback: Vec<crate::events::Feedback>,`

What the attempts before this one failed on, oldest first. Empty for a
first dispatch, which has nothing to be told.

## `struct RunAs` › `attempt: AttemptNumber,`

Which attempt of the generation.

## `struct RunAs` › `rung: u32,`

Which rung of the frozen ladder.

## `struct RunAs` › `resume_session: Option<SessionId>,`

The session this attempt resumes, if any.

## `struct RunAs` › `announced: bool,`

Whether `attempt_started` is already durable.

## `pub struct Brief {`

§11.4's accumulated brief, derived from the durable record.

"Failure feedback (gate log or `required_changes`) goes back to the *same
rung* … `attempts_per` exhausted → next rung, fresh session, **accumulated
feedback summary included**." The brief is what that sentence sends.

**Derived rather than accumulated, for the reason §15 states.** "One fold,
not two": the engine "appends an event and folds it back in through the same
function `resume` and `status` use … and it applies the event *as it will be
read back* rather than as constructed". [`Self::replay`] is that reader and
[`Self::record`] is the single step it is made of, so the live loop —
recording each settlement from the record it is appending, never from the
live `AttemptFailure` beside it — reaches the identical value a replay of
its own log does. The shape is [`super::select::Spend`]'s, and so is the
argument.

This was a `BTreeMap` the live path pushed to and `TopologyRun::resumed`
created empty. A crash after a gate failure therefore threw away the
diagnostic tail: the retry ran on attempt 1's prompt, spent a rung's
allowance to be told nothing, and could repeat the same defect. The
2026-08-26 frontier review of `75da796` raised it as finding 2; the durable
field it needed is authorised by
`decisions/2026-08-26-durable-retry-feedback.md`.

## `impl Brief` › `pub fn new() -> Self {`

Nothing recorded yet.

## `impl Brief` › `pub fn lines(&self, key: TaskKey) -> Vec<crate::events::Feedback> {`

What this task's earlier attempts failed on, oldest first.

## `impl Brief` › `pub fn record(&mut self, key: TaskKey, record: &AttemptRecord) {`

Add one settled attempt's line to its task's brief.

**Every judged failure adds one, whatever settlement it produced.** The
sentence is "failure feedback goes back to the same rung, **and an
escalation carries the accumulated feedback with it**", and an escalation
closes the generation — so the brief belongs to the *task*. Gating it on
a retained generation is what made every escalation and every sessionless
retry, which is every Copilot attempt (`DESIGN.md:452`), start from
nothing.

A record with no failure adds nothing: a successful attempt has no
feedback, and `detail` is `None` on an attempt nothing judged.

## `impl Brief` › `pub fn replay(events: &[TopologyEvent]) -> Self {`

Every task's brief over a whole log.

**`attempt_finished` only, which is exactly the live loop's coverage.**
Two events carry an [`AttemptRecord`] — `attempt_finished` and
`candidate_prepared` — and the driver calls [`Self::record`] beside
`Spend::record` at both of its own appends. `candidate_prepared` is the
*successful* settlement (INV-07), so its record carries no failure and
contributes nothing either way; walking it here would add a duplicate
only on the replay side. `attempt_interrupted` is deliberately absent:
nothing judged that attempt, the live path settles it in recovery rather
than through a settlement, and a line for it would be a line replay
invented.

## `struct Retained {`

What the retaining incarnation kept from the attempt it settled.

The tree a retry re-gates, and what that attempt failed on. Both are
process-local on purpose: `T-RETAINED` is "the retaining incarnation
proceeds to T-RETRY; a fresh process closes it in recovery", so only the
process that settled the attempt may continue it, and the fold's
`RetainedIdle { incarnation }` refuses any other.

## `struct Retained` › `tree: String,`

`Quiescence::HoldsTree`'s subject: the cumulative work the retry re-gates.

## `struct Produced<'a> {`

What one attempt produced, for the settlement that reads all three.

The counterpart to [`Judging`], one phase later: judging reads the
identities, the tree and the cheap rungs; settling reads the tree, the
worker's own report and the verdict. A bundle for the same reason — they
arrive together, are read together, and passing them singly put `settle` at
eight arguments.

## `struct Produced<'a>` › `capture: &'a Capture,`

The exact tree the attempt captured.

## `struct Produced<'a>` › `assessed: &'a Assessment,`

What the ladder's cheap rungs said, and the adapter's parse beside it.

## `struct Produced<'a>` › `judgement: &'a Judgement,`

What the gates and reviewers said.

## `pub enum Progress {`

What one iteration of the loop did.

A value rather than `()` so a **test** asserts on the branch that ran rather
than on the absence of an error, and so that a driving loop can tell "made
progress" from "waited" — the difference between a loop that is working and
one that is spinning.

**The sentence used to name `drive` as that loop's caller and `drive` does
not exist**. `grep -rn 'fn drive' --include='*.rs' src/ | grep -v '///'`
finds a hook-harness helper in `topology/effects.rs` and two test helpers —
`drive_into_the_kill` and `drive_a_report` — and no loop that consumes
`Progress`. The first draft added "and nothing in `src/engine/`", which the
command's own output contradicts: two of the three *are* under
`src/engine/`. `PR7-R6-ATT-008`. The doc-comment filter is the other half —
a needle quoted here would otherwise match its own quotation,
`reviews/FINDINGS.md` §4. That is
verbatim the defect this module's own header exists because of — "six
independent readers all assumed the driver existed" — reproduced in the
justification for a type. `PR7-R3-CONTRACT-007`; confirmed against the tree
and corrected 2026-08-26. `step`'s callers in this slice are its tests; the
loop that consumes `Progress` in production is PR8's.

## `pub enum Progress` › `Settled {`

One attempt ran, was judged, and its settlement is **durable**.

The whole of the ready-dispatch branch: ceiling check, reservation,
dispatch, the attempt through the Runner, and the settlement append —
**which append that is depends on `accepted`**.

A rejected attempt ends at `attempt_finished`: `settle` builds the record,
asks the ladder for the next step, and emits the event `settle_failed`
shaped. An accepted attempt **never appends `attempt_finished`** — `settle`
takes the `promote_candidate` path before it reaches any of that, and the
branch ends at `candidate_prepared` followed by `task_candidate_created`.
`candidate_prepared` is the sole successful settlement
(`design/15_design_event_log_resume_run_layout.md`,
`design/26_design_merge_queue_protocol.md` §26), it carries the attempt
record itself, and `check_attempt_finished` refuses `Succeeded` outright, so
a reader reconstructing a successful attempt's durable record who goes
looking for an `attempt_finished` will not find one. `accepted` is the flag
that says which of the two sequences was written.

## `pub enum Progress` › `key: TaskKey,`

Whose attempt.

## `pub enum Progress` › `accepted: bool,`

Whether the verification ladder found nothing to reject.

## `pub enum Progress` › `spent_attempt: bool,`

Whether this settlement spent one of the rung's `attempts_per`, as
`ladder::spends_allowance` prices it. The input the **next** ladder
decision reads, which is why it is carried out of the branch rather
than derived again there.

## `pub enum Progress` › `GenerationClosed {`

A retained generation's worktree did not verify, so the generation
closed instead of retrying.

Not a failure of the task: `generation_closed{WorktreeMissing}` leaves
it dispatchable from a fresh generation, which is what the next
iteration selects.

## `pub enum Progress` › `key: TaskKey,`

Whose generation.

## `pub enum Progress` › `Integrated {`

One candidate published: `merge_prepared`, the compare-and-swap and
`task_merged` are durable, and every task in `satisfies` is `Merged`.

## `pub enum Progress` › `Rejected {`

One candidate rejected: `merge_rejected` is durable, its repair
registered, and the rejected task is `AwaitingRepair`. No repair was
dispatched — that is PR9's.

## `pub enum Progress` › `Unavailable {`

One verification could not be run: `merge_verification_unavailable` is
durable, deferred (the candidate waits for a wake) or `parked` (a
question is open and the task is `AwaitingInput`).

## `pub enum Progress` › `Answered {`

One verification-park question ingested: `question_answered` is
durable, and the candidate is back in the queue (`declined` false) or
its lineage has failed (`declined` true).

## `pub enum Progress` › `Finished {`

The run ended: closure appended `run_finished` and terminal finalization
ran. Replaces `Blocked`, which PR9 returned when nobody answered the hard
block: since PR10 the hard block falls through to closure (record §3 R2), so
an unanswered question ends the run Parked rather than leaving it neither
running nor ended.

A further `step` is refused — `Step::Finished` does not cross the
checkpoint — with the outcome in the message.

## `pub enum Progress` › `outcome: RunOutcome,`

The outcome `run_finished` recorded.

## `pub enum Progress` › `closed: usize,`

How many open generations closure closed `RunEnding` on the way.

## `pub enum Progress` › `report_written: bool,`

Whether finalization wrote `report.json`, or found the file current by
digest.

## `pub enum Progress` › `execution_root_removed: bool,`

Whether the emptied execution root was pruned (R18).

## `pub enum Progress` › `Waited {`

The defer backoff elapsed and `defer_wait_elapsed` is durable.

## `pub enum Progress` › `waited_ms: u64,`

How long this round slept.

## `pub enum Progress` › `round: u32,`

Which wait it was.

## `pub enum Progress` › `BudgetExceeded,`

A ceiling refused the next spawn and `budget_exceeded` is durable.

`loop`: a breach "appends `budget_exceeded` before any effect and
**proceeds to closure**" — the next iteration selects `Closure` and
[`TopologyRun::close_run`] ends the run `BudgetExceeded`. The append and
the closure are deliberately two iterations: the record of the breach is
durable either way, which is what makes a closure that fails diagnosable.

## `pub struct TopologyRun {`

`TopologyRun` — the schema-4 run, driven.

Owns exactly what a run owns: the fold, the append handle, the two locks
(inside [`RunHandle`]), the two provisional ledgers, and the ceiling it was
configured with. Everything else is a seam.

**It owns the slot assertion (R3)**, and the sentence here said it did not.
`slots: SlotAssertion` is a field of this struct, `TopologyRun::resumed`
initialises it with `SlotAssertion::new()`, and `fn attempt` threads
`slots: &mut self.slots` into the one production `AttemptContext`. Named
rather than cited by line: the correction that replaced this paragraph made
it thirteen lines longer, so the `run.rs:615` the first draft carried — correct
**at `9b6fef1`** — now points **into the correction itself**. `R5-SEAMS`/`PR7-R5-ATT-007`, and
CLAUDE.md's trap list already names stale line anchors as a repeat cost. The denial was written
while that was true — "a field nothing reads is a claim the code does not
back" — and stayed after the branch that uses it arrived.
`PR7-R3-CONTRACT-006`; confirmed against the tree and corrected 2026-08-26.
`SlotAssertion::balances()` has to be true at process end, and that is the
claim the field carries.

## `pub struct TopologyRun` › `brief: Brief,`

§11.4's accumulated brief, per task, oldest first.

**Separate from [`Retained`] because the brief outlives the retained
generation.** §11.4 is "failure feedback goes back to the same rung, and
an escalation carries the accumulated feedback with it" — so it belongs
to the *task*, not to a generation. Holding it inside `Retained` meant it
existed only for `AttemptSettlement::Retained`, which `settle::retry`
produces only for a resumable same-rung retry **with** a session. Every
escalation and every sessionless retry — which is every Copilot attempt,
`DESIGN.md:452` — therefore ran on attempt 1's prompt.

**Durable, and derived from the log.** This field said schema 4's wire
could not carry it and that a resume therefore restarted the brief empty
— true when written, and the defect the 2026-08-26 frontier review of
`75da796` raised as finding 2. [`crate::events::FailureRecord::detail`]
now carries what §11.4 sends, and [`Brief`] derives the whole map from
the log by the same step the live loop applies.
`PR7-FEEDBACK-NOT-DURABLE-IN-SCHEMA-4` in `reviews/FINDINGS.md` §2 is
closed by that field, authorised as Class C in
`decisions/2026-08-26-durable-retry-feedback.md`.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub fn resumed(handle: RunHandle, inputs: FrozenInputs, ceiling: Ceiling) -> Self {`

Take over a run a completed recovery handed back.

`run_recovery_order` returns the handle beside its summary; this is the
caller that consumes it. Before the handle existed, the order dropped
the log, the fold and both locks, and there was nothing for this
function to take.

## `pub fn resumed(handle: RunHandle, inputs: FrozenInputs, ceiling: Ceiling) -> Self {` › `committed_first_line_sha256: Some(handle.committed_first_line_sha256.clone()),`

The digest recovery verified, not `None`. A loop that dropped it
would make its own appends unable to report a creator
disposition, while recovery's emitter — over the same run —
could.

## `pub fn resumed(handle: RunHandle, inputs: FrozenInputs, ceiling: Ceiling) -> Self {` › `let spend = Spend::replay(&handle.events);`

Read before the handle moves into the struct below it.

## `pub fn resumed(handle: RunHandle, inputs: FrozenInputs, ceiling: Ceiling) -> Self {` › `let brief = Brief::replay(&handle.events);`

**The log's brief, not an empty map.** Same reader, same reason as
`spend`: §11.4's feedback is on the durable record now, so a resumed
run tells the next worker what the attempts before the crash failed
on rather than handing it attempt 1's prompt.

## `pub fn resumed(handle: RunHandle, inputs: FrozenInputs, ceiling: Ceiling) -> Self {` › `spend,`

**The log's spend, not a fresh counter.** `Spend::replay` is
documented as the reader "a resumed process rebuilds this with",
and until this line it had **no production caller** — every
restart started the run's ceiling again at zero, so a run that had
spent its budget resumed with the whole of it back.

Third occurrence of the §4 class, and the one that re-scoped it:
`C2` witnessed `Spend::replay`'s accumulation and its live-vs-
replay parity, and nothing witnessed the *read*. The class was
filed as "a fold field's witness proves the accumulation and not
the read" and `Spend` is not literally a fold field — it behaves
as one, and the narrow name is what let this through.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub fn commitment_digest(&self) -> Option<&str> {`

The digest this run's appends prove their committed first line against.

`establish_stable_prefix` skips the check entirely when this is `None` —
`if let Some(expected)` — so a loop that lost it would reopen after an
append error and accept a first line the commit record does not name.
That is `PR31-CONTRACT-006`, and the answer is `EMIT-002`'s: the handle
carries the digest recovery verified and this is where it lands.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub fn holds_entitlement(&mut self) -> bool {`

Whether this run is still holding a pipeline entitlement.

The `Reservations` counterpart of [`Self::invocations_balance`], and it
exists for the same reason: `permits.protocol` is "registered exactly
once, settled exactly once", and a claim about a ledger is checkable
only if something can ask the ledger.

**A step that refused must leave nothing held.** Three catalogue entries
— `PR7-PIPELINE-014`, `PR7-SELECT-024`, `PR7-SELECT-033` — take an
entitlement before the step that can refuse and leak it on the refusing
path, and all three were green because no test asked this question.

## `pub fn holds_entitlement(&mut self) -> bool` › `self.reservations.cancel_any()`

`cancel_any` reports whether there was one *and* releases it, which
is exactly right here: the run is being inspected after the step it
was supposed to have released on, and leaving it held would make the
next assertion in the same test read a stale ledger.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub fn invocations_balance(&self) -> bool {`

Whether every Runner process this run registered was also settled.

R4's "registered and settled exactly once", as a question a test can
ask. It is the ledger's own answer; nothing here re-derives it.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub const fn spend(&self) -> &Spend {`

What this process believes the run has spent.

Paired with `Spend::replay` over the same log, this is the parity a
resumed run depends on.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub fn fold(&self) -> &TopologyFold {`

The fold this run derives every decision from.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub fn warnings(&self) -> &[String] {`

Warnings accumulated across the run, in order.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `#[allow(dead_code)]` (trailing)

never called at 610106b; see `PR7-NARROWED-SURFACE-19-UNCALLED` (§2)

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub fn entitlements_held(&self) -> u32 {`

How many pipeline entitlements this run currently holds.

Exposed so a test can assert the provisional ledger is balanced after a
branch that refused partway. At `max_parallel = 1` a single leaked
entitlement is a full pipeline, and nothing is ever selected again.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub const fn reservations_cancelled(&self) -> u32 {`

How many provisional reservations this run cancelled.

Exposed so a test can tell a reservation that converted at its append
from one the failure path cancelled: the review of `79ddbffb` read the
empty ledger after an unresolved verification as a release, and the count
is what says it was a conversion (`pr8-triage.md` §6 finding 5).

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub fn defer_round(&self) -> u32 {`

Which wait the defer backoff is on.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `#[allow(dead_code)]` (trailing)

never called at 610106b; see `PR7-NARROWED-SURFACE-19-UNCALLED` (§2)

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pub fn step(`

One iteration of `decisions.sequential_substrate.loop`.

**Select, checkpoint, then act — and the order is the guarantee.**
`select` appends nothing and performs nothing; `checkpoint` refuses on a
value nothing has acted on, so `checkpoint_refusals`' "before any
append" holds by construction rather than by this function remembering
to check early enough.

**Answers first.** Before selecting, `ingest_answers` polls every open
question through the non-blocking half of the answer source; the first
answer found is ingested and the step ends there (`Progress::Answered`),
so an answer a person left while the engine was away moves the run
before any other branch spends anything.

**Every step runs inside the run lock's cleanup scope.** A Unix reaper
reads its cleanup-lease paths from the thread-local scope when it is
spawned, and a reaper spawned with none active holds no lease: the next
coordinator's exclusive probe (R28, `INV-18.recovery`) then finds nothing
to refuse on while that reaper still reclaims a gate's process group. The
v0.1 coordinator enters the scope beside its lock; this loop's attempt
path never had, and the integration path routed its gates and reviewers
through the same omission — the cover review of `8a5f59e8` measured a
real reaper at `ReaperStarted` with the run's hold absent
(`PR8-R4-CLEANUP-LEASE`). The scope is entered at the top of the step and
dropped with it, on the thread that drives the step, which is what a
thread-local registration needs.


### Errors

The checkpoint refusals — integration, run end, and a poisoned fold —
each of which ends the command. Otherwise whatever the branch returns,
or [`LoopBranch::unimplemented`] for a branch this build has not
written, which performs nothing and appends nothing.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `Admitted::BudgetExceeded(exceeded) => {`

`loop`: "a breach appends `budget_exceeded` before any effect".
The append is the whole of this arm — there is no effect after it
to be before.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `Admitted::Backoff => {`

"sleep the defer backoff and append `defer_wait_elapsed`" — in
that order, and `Deferral::wait` owns it. The sleep is first
because the event records a wait that *elapsed*: appending it
first would put a claim in the log that a kill during the sleep
would make false.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `feedback: self.brief.lines(key),`

**Not empty.** A fresh generation is not a fresh
task: `settle::failed` closes the generation and
retries from a new one for every sessionless retry
and every escalation, and §11.4 says the accumulated
feedback goes with it. Empty here meant a retried
worker got attempt 1's prompt verbatim — a rung's
allowance spent to be told nothing.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn dispatch_ready(`

The first three clauses of the ready-dispatch branch: reserve, dispatch,
convert.

**The reservation is provisional and it is converted at the append, not
after it.** `permits.pipeline` counts unresolved transactions in the
held count, and O24's "converted at `task_dispatched`" is what stops a
dispatch that appended from still occupying an entitlement. A conversion
placed after the worktree effects would hold the entitlement across two
Git commands for no reason, and one placed before the append would
release it for a dispatch that never happened.

**And it is cancelled on every failure path**, which is
`refusals`' "cancellation on any pre-append failure". A leaked
reservation is not a hypothetical here: it is `PR7-O24-DOUBLE-VERIFICATION`,
where two verifications of one worktree could leave a generation neither
closed nor converted.

### Errors

Whatever [`dispatch`] refuses or fails at, with the reservation
cancelled first. Or [`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when the task is not one
the registry knows, which is a fold and a registry that disagree.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `self.reservations.take(key, ReservationKind::Dispatch)?;`

Provisional, before the effect it authorizes.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let _ = self.reservations.cancel(key, ReservationKind::Dispatch);`

Cancel before returning, and do not let a cancellation
failure hide the failure that caused it: the first error is
the one an operator needs.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn hard_block(`

The hard-block branch: **apply the hard-block rules.** When no question
resolves to an answer — an unattended source, or a person who left the
prompt unanswered — the branch falls through to [`TopologyRun::close_run`]
(record §3 R2): with nothing runnable, no backoff pending and only open
questions in the way, the run's derived outcome is Parked, and Parked is a
terminal a resume reopens with `run_resumed`. PR9 returned `Blocked` here.

`loop`: "else apply the hard-block rules (attached-terminal prompt or
`wait_on_block` for open questions)". Which of the two applies is
**not** decided here — `interaction::answers_for` decides it, and its
own doc says why: "`on_block` at an attached terminal means *prompt*,
and the identical config detached means *wait for `upstroke answer`*.
Deciding it here rather than in the engine keeps that distinction where
the channels live." This branch asks the source it is handed and does
not know which channel it got.

### What it does with an answer

Ingests it. Each open question is resolved in id order and the first
answer goes through `answer_for` and `ingest_answer`: `question_answered`
is appended and the fold routes it — `AwaitingMerge` for a verification
park, `Pending` for an admission (a `HumanBinding` one carrying the
override the answer derived), a failed lineage for a decline, halting
per the run's `halts_run` seam. `Answer::Unanswered` is not an answer:
it is the detached case reporting that nobody was there, and the run
stays blocked, which is exactly what the rule prescribes. The
non-blocking half of the same path is `ingest_answers`, which `step`
runs before it selects.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn open_question(&self, id: &QuestionId) -> Result<OpenAsked, UpstrokeError> {`

One open question, in the shape [`crate::interaction::AnswerSource`]
reads, with what `answer_for` needs beside it.

The fold froze the id, kind, context and options when the settlement
parked; `affected_tasks` is the display id the registry holds for the
key it froze. Nothing is re-decided — `T-FAILED` is explicit that a
question is rematerialized from the event and "never re-decided". The
rest of `OpenAsked` is what the fold kept with the question: the key,
the `QuestionOrigin`, and for a `HumanBinding` admission the authorized
agents its options index into.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn continue_open(`

**`T-DISPATCH`'s "continue attempt (no spend repeats)".**

A run killed between `task_dispatched` and `attempt_started` leaves the
generation `OpenNoAttempt`. Its `task_dispatched` is already durable and
the fold refuses a second, so this reuses the ground instead of opening
it: `Worktree.Verify` at the recorded base, or a forced recreate, and
then the same attempt the fresh path runs. No spend repeats because
nothing was spent — no attempt started.

`resume_open_no_attempt` is what performs it, and this is the caller the
design was waiting for: recovery step (g) recreated these worktrees and
nothing then started an attempt in them, so the run stalled with the
pipeline entitlement held by a generation no branch could select.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `source: match &kind {`

A repair's source is the candidate its own `task_dispatched` recorded
(`dispatched_source`), never re-derived from the registry: the
continuation re-materializes exactly what the interrupted dispatch
materialized.

**For a repair the continuation is where the materialization happens
again (`R6`).** Recovery (g) verifies or recreates the worktree at its
base and materializes nothing, so a repair worktree is at its base when
the loop reaches it — recreated there, or verified there still holding
the index a completed pick left — and `resume_open_no_attempt` runs the
pick once, afresh in either case: the materialization funnel restores the
base's tree before it picks, because a second pick onto the merged index
is not a no-op and applies the hunk again (the record's §12, finding 3,
measured it). Its observation is what `attempt_started` records.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn retry_ready(`

The first half of the ready-retry branch: **reserve, verify, and start
the next attempt in the retained generation.**

`loop`: "if a retained generation exists: {pipeline} reservation, next
attempt in the retained generation". `settle::retry` owns the order and
every step of it — the reservation before the verify, because
`permits.provisional_reservations` calls it "the bridge between a
selection decision and its first append" and the verify is already past
the decision; then `Worktree.Verify` for a worktree that is present,
quiescent and still holding the retained tree.

A retained repair generation retries in place like any other and
records `Materialization::Retained` rather than materializing again: the
worktree it re-enters is the one the previous attempt left, pick
included (`ST-15`, repair). The materialization funnel clears the pick's
state files for exactly this verification's sake.

**`Quiescence::HoldsTree`, not `AtBase`.** A retained generation's whole
point is that the worktree carries the previous attempt's cumulative
work, so HEAD is still the base and the index is what differs. That tree
comes from [`Self::retained`] — the note this process made when it
settled the attempt — and it is process-local on purpose: `T-RETAINED`'s
resume action is "the retaining incarnation proceeds to T-RETRY; a fresh
process closes it in recovery", and the fold's
`RetainedIdle { incarnation }` refuses one that tries otherwise.

A verify failure is not an error: the generation closes, the reservation
is cancelled, and `generation_closed{WorktreeMissing}` is appended.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let pool = seams.plans.pool_for(&binding.agent);`

Read before `binding` moves into the request below it.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `pool: pool.clone(),`

Through the seam that owns the frozen pool table, not a
second lookup here. The dispatch arm reads `plan.pool`;
this arm appends before its plan exists, so it asks the
same authority one step earlier (`R3-SEAMS-001`).

## `impl TopologyRun` › `feedback: self.brief.lines(key),`

§11.4: what the attempts before this one failed on.
From the task's brief, which every judged failure adds to
— not from the retained generation, which only a resumable
same-rung retry ever produces.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `announced: true,`

`settle::retry` built this event; appending it is what
announces the attempt, and the fold refuses a second.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `self.emit(`

The reservation was already cancelled by `retry`.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `const FIRST_ATTEMPT: crate::topology::events::AttemptNumber =`

The attempt number a fresh generation's first attempt carries.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn attempt(`

The fourth clause of the ready-dispatch branch: **run one attempt
through the Runner.**

`attempt_started`, the worker, the exact-tree capture, the gate set on
one shared snapshot, and each reviewer on a fresh one — in that order,
which is [`AttemptContext`]'s, not a second one. This function's whole
job is to assemble what that machinery reads and to hand it the seams
its effects go through, and it is what makes the driver
`review::run_review`'s **second production caller**.

**The settle write is not here.** What comes back is a [`Judgement`] no
event records yet; the caller appends it, immediately after this
returns.

### This block was re-targeted, and two of its sentences went false

It was written for this function and an insertion moved it onto
`FIRST_ATTEMPT`, where it stayed while the code beneath it changed —
`PR7-R2-CONTRACT-005`, the doc-re-targeting class's second site. Both
corrections are recorded rather than quietly applied, because a doc that
has been wrong is worth more as a warning than as clean prose:

1. It said "the branch's `owes` says so". [`LoopBranch::owes`] has
   **zero call sites** in the crate. The clause it named was never a
   thing the code did.
2. It carried a section titled *"Attempt 1, rung 0, and why neither is
   read from the fold"*, arguing they were properties of the branch. That
   was true when written and is now the opposite of the code: both are
   read from the fold, because assuming them was `C1` — a task resumed
   mid-ladder dispatched at rung 0, attempt 1, forever. The argument the
   section made against a fold reader is the argument this slice had to
   abandon.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let entry = self`

**Cloned once, before the emitter takes the fold.** The plan is built
before the worker runs and the review inputs after it, and the
emitter holds `&mut fold` across both — so a reference taken here
would not survive to the second read. One registry entry is a few
strings; the alternative is the driver copying the five fields
`inputs` reads, which is assembly logic in the one place that must
not hold any.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let run = if run_as.announced {`

**`attempt_started` is the retry branch's, not this one's.** A retry
appends it inside `settle::retry`, after the worktree verified, so a
second append here would be refused by the fold — and rightly: the
verify is what makes the claim true.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let assessed = cx.assess(site, &plan, &run, &capture, &diff, entry.spec.kind)?;`

The ladder's cheap rungs, before the expensive ones. `judge` starts
from this rather than from `None`, so a worker that died or produced
no diff never reaches a gate or a frontier reviewer.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn close_run(`

Run-end closure, the acting half of `closure.md`: the ending outcome is
read first (`closure::ending_outcome`), the shapes this build cannot close
are refused (`closure::refuse_unclosable`, naming PR11), every closable
generation is closed `RunEnding { outcome }` with its close appended and
its slot scrubbed after the append, a provisional reservation still held
is cancelled with a warning, the derivation is confirmed against the
closed fold, `run_finished` is appended, and terminal finalization runs
(`finalize::finalize`). The `Progress::Finished` it returns carries what
finalization did.

A kill or an append error inside the sequence leaves a prefix the next
process's recovery completes: a `generation_closed` without its
`run_finished` is a closed generation the sweep reclaims and a closure the
next loop repeats; a torn `run_finished` is truncated by the next open and
appended again (ST-17, `kill_inside_closure_recovers`,
`append_error_inside_closure_ends_command_and_resume_completes_closure`).

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn settle(`

The branch's last clause: **settle the attempt.**

`settle_failed` decides the transition, the parking, the deferral count,
whether the generation survives, the lease disposition and the
allowance — all of it, once. Nothing here re-decides any of them: the
lease disposition comes from `GenerationLease::expected`, which is the
whole of that rule, and the allowance from `ladder::spends_allowance`.
This function's job is to hand that module the three answers only the
run has — what the ladder decided, what the record says, and what the
run's policy does with a terminal failure.

### Every case of the branch, and nothing refused

A success goes through the candidate sequence; a retry, an escalation
and a terminal failure settle directly; an outage defers from
`TaskFold::defers` (`PR7-FOLD-DEFERS-ACCUMULATOR`); and a park raises
its question through [`Self::park_question`] before the settlement that
records it. Two of those were refusals until the readers they needed
existed, and both refusals are gone with their causes.

### A closed settlement scrubs its slot

Every `Closed` transition — retry, escalation, deferral, park, terminal
failure — closes the generation in the fold, and R9's lifecycle says of a
closed generation "pruned (forced); intent removed". Since PR10 the slot is
scrubbed right after the `attempt_finished` append, as the retry path's
`Close` arm and run-end closure already did for the closes they make.
Before that every closed settlement other than a promotion left its
worktree and intent for the next resume's sweep, and the ledger at Parked
found the execution root not removed (record §6). The order is the durable
close first, then the scrub: a kill between the two leaves a closed
generation whose residue recovery reclaims, never a scrubbed generation
the fold still holds open.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `feedback: crate::engine::classify::FeedbackCarrier::AttemptRecord,`

Schema 4 has no other carrier: no `SettlementTransition`
variant holds feedback, so this record is where §11.4's text
survives a crash or it does not survive one.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `return Ok(crate::ladder::spends_allowance(None));`

Through the authority, not as a literal. `spends_allowance`'s
`None` arm is "the worker ran, and its work was judged and
accepted" — the same sentence, decided in the one place that is
total over `FailureKind`. A `true` here would be a second answer
to a question the ladder already owns, and the next cell someone
changes there would not reach this path.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let position = self.ladder_position(site.key)?;`

Where the task stands on its ladder, from the log rather than from
this branch's assumptions.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let attempts_on_rung =`

**The rung's allowance, including the attempt in hand.**

The fold counts an attempt at its *settlement*, because that is when
`spends_allowance` can answer — its line is "the worker ran and
produced work to judge", which `attempt_started` cannot know.
`next_step` runs one step earlier: it *decides* the transition this
settlement will carry, so the append has not happened and the fold's
count does not yet include this attempt.

So the driver asks the same question about the one attempt the fold
has not seen. That is one rule with one implementation consulted about
two subjects — the settled attempts and the live one — and not a
second implementation: change a cell in `spends_allowance` and both
move together, which is exactly what failed to happen while the fold
counted starts.

Bound once and read twice, by the ladder and by the question a park
raises. A park that quoted a different number than the ladder decided
on would send an operator looking for a run that did not happen.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `resumable: plan.session_resume && assessed.outcome.session_id.is_some(),`

Three conjuncts: the two `LadderState::resumable` documents —
the agent's CLI advertises `session_resume` and this attempt
actually returned a session to resume — and, since this slice,
`capture.unresolved.is_empty()`: a refused capture (an unmerged
entry undeclared, a manifest that does not parse, a path
declared both ways or in another case) carries the base's tree
and the attempt it fails is not resumed, so a refused manifest
is corrected in a fresh generation, not in place (`design/26`
§26.4). Any one false closes the generation and retries from a
fresh one. (Until PR #249's sixth repair round this paragraph
named the first two only.)

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let question = match next {`

**The question a park raises, built once here.** `settle_failed`
refuses a parking settlement that carries none, and
`rematerialize_question` reads it back out of the event on resume
rather than re-deciding it — so a question invented at the resume
would have to word itself identically, which is the duplication this
slice keeps paying for.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `if matches!(`

**The retaining incarnation's own note.** `T-RETAINED`'s resume action
is "the retaining incarnation proceeds to T-RETRY; a fresh process
closes it in recovery", so the tree a retry re-gates is legitimately
process-local: a different process may not use it, and the fold's
`RetainedIdle { incarnation }` is what refuses one that tries.

The retained *tree* is per-generation where the brief above is
per-task: `Quiescence::HoldsTree` is a claim about a worktree this
process left in place, and only a `Retained` settlement leaves one.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `self.spend.record(site.key, &settled.event.record);`

The ceiling's ledger, before the append: `Spend::replay` rebuilds it
from the log on resume, so this keeps the in-process copy current for
the next iteration's ceiling check rather than being a second source
for it.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `self.brief.record(site.key, &settled.event.record);`

**§11.4's brief, from the record being appended.** Not from the
`AttemptFailure` beside it: `Brief::replay` reads this event back off
the log, and applying the event as it will be read back is what makes
a live run and a replay of its own log one computation rather than two
that agree by inspection (§15, "one fold, not two").

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn promote_candidate(`

The candidate sequence for an attempt nothing rejected.

`side_effect_vs_event_ordering`: "commit object (R27) before pin
(IdUnread between); pin before candidate_prepared; candidates ref after
candidate_prepared and before task_candidate_created".

**The settlement is `candidate_prepared`**, so there is no append between
the pin and it. This said the settlement "lands between the pin and
`candidate_prepared`" and cited settle_succeeded's note — the note that
reinterpreted INV-07, and the function the 2026-08-27 CONFORM ruling
deleted. `T-CAND-OBJ`'s window covers the commit object and the pin with
`authoritative_state: attempt unsettled`, and it stays unsettled until
this event.

**The reinterpretation that stood here is deleted, not softened.** It
read: INV-07's "candidate_prepared is the sole successful attempt
settlement" is about which event records the *candidate*, not which
settles the attempt, so without `attempt_finished(Succeeded)` the
generation never reaches `Promoting`. Both halves are now false and the
second was the mechanism the first was invented to justify:
`apply_candidate_prepared` sets `Promoting` itself, in the same block
that records the candidate, and `check_attempt_finished` refuses
`Succeeded` outright. The sentence survived the 2026-08-27 CONFORM
ruling by sitting three paragraphs under the paragraph that corrects
it, which is how the `b1f54a5` review found it and why
`drivers/deleted-mechanisms.sh` now reads a claim's own sentence rather
than the block around it.

### Why `complete_promotion` was split to make this callable

It took `hooks` **and** a journal. The driver's journal must hold
`hooks` to emit through [`emit`], and one `&mut dyn TopologyHooks`
cannot be both. The test journal sidesteps that by holding a *different*
events bundle — the two-observation-surface divergence
`reviews/FINDINGS.md` records — and production must not, because then
the candidate sequence's appends would not be the ones the harness sees.

So `complete_promotion` is now the composition of three halves that
alternate between the two borrows, with its own typestate carrying the
order. Its signature is unchanged and every existing caller still
compiles.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let actual_paths = seams.manager.changed_paths(site.slot, &capture.parent)?;`

**The region the diff actually touched**, read through the manager
rather than predicted: `lease_effect` is `ReplacesPredicted`, and the
whole point of that variant is that the prediction is replaced by the
measurement.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `self.spend.record(key, &record);`

Between the pin and `candidate_prepared`, and in that order.
**No `attempt_finished` here.** `candidate_prepared` is the sole
successful settlement for a candidate-producing attempt —
`design/26_design_merge_queue_protocol.md` §26, which adds
"`attempt_finished` is not also emitted for that attempt" — and this
path appended both until the 2026-08-27 ruling. The fold now refuses
either half of that pair, so the omission is enforced rather than
remembered.

The record still reaches the ledger: `append_candidate_prepared`
carries it on the event that settles the attempt, which is where the
record was always specified to live.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `self.brief.record(key, &record);`

A succeeded record carries no failure and adds no brief line. Called
anyway so that `Brief::record`'s coverage is identical to
`Brief::replay`'s by construction rather than equal by argument —
replay walks every settlement, and this is one.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let promoting = self.with_journal(seams, hooks, |journal| {`

The three halves alternate between the hooks bundle and the journal,
and the journal must hold the bundle to emit through `emit`. So each
half runs with the borrow it needs and the typestate carries the
order between them: only `append_candidate_prepared` makes a
`PromotingCandidate`, only `create_candidates_ref` makes a
`ReferencedCandidate`, and only `append_candidate_created` makes a
`CreatedCandidate`.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn with_journal<T>(`

Lend the run's state to the candidate sequence as a [`CandidateJournal`].

A closure rather than a stored field because the journal borrows the
fold, the log and the hooks, and the sequence's effect halves need the
hooks back between appends.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn display_id(&self, key: TaskKey) -> Result<String, UpstrokeError> {`

The display id the frozen registry gave this task.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn park_question(`

The question a parked attempt raises.

Every word of it comes from the legacy authorities:
`coordinator::question_context` for the prose the human reads and
`coordinator::topology_question_options` for what they can answer — the
schema-4 list, which does not promise that typed text reaches the agent,
because `question_answered` carries no field for it. The driver
supplies only what the frozen registry knows — the display id, the
title, the acceptance list — and what this branch knows about the
attempt.

**`attempts` is the task's spend on this rung, from the fold.** It was
`plan.attempt` — this generation's attempt number — which restarts at
one for a same-rung retry that did not resume, so a park after two
attempts told the human "1 attempt(s)".

**And `rungs_spent` was the literal `1`**, with a comment saying a
multi-rung count was "owed with the escalation lane" — while this slice
claimed that lane delivered. A two-rung chain at `attempts_per = 1` that
exhausts told the operator *"1 attempt(s) across 1 rung(s) all failed"*
when two attempts across two rungs had. The frontier review of
`75da796`, finding 3.

**Both numbers now come from the fold, and both match the legacy
authority's rule.** `coordinator::ParkSubject::of` — the schema-3 path
that ships today — counts `attempts` as the task's total across every
record and `rungs_spent` as the number of *distinct tiers* those records
name, floored at one. Here:

* total attempts is the sum of every generation's `attempts`, because
  `GenerationFold::attempts` is the highest attempt number started in
  that generation and the number restarts at each new generation — so a
  single generation's count is what the old code passed, and the sum is
  the task's;
* rungs spent is `task.rung + 1`, floored at one. Rungs are dense and
  monotonic — `settle`'s escalation moves a task to `rung + 1` and
  nothing moves it back — so the count of distinct **rungs** a task has
  occupied *is* its current rung plus one.

**It is not always the same number the legacy path computes, and this
used to claim it was.** `ParkSubject::of` counts distinct *tiers* with a
`BTreeSet`; a rung is an index into the chain, and `ChainSummary.tiers`
is a `Vec<Tier>` that nothing deduplicates. For a chain naming the same
tier twice — `chain = ["small", "small"]`, which config accepts — a task
that exhausts both rungs is 2 here and 1 there. The 2026-08-26 re-review
of `c2c0294` found the claim, finding C.

**The two are answering different questions and this one is the right
one for the sentence it builds.** The question is "how much of your
ladder did this task spend before it asked for you", and a chain with a
repeated tier really does have two rungs to spend: the task ran twice,
at two allowances, and telling the operator "1 rung" would understate it
in exactly the direction finding 3 was about. The legacy count is the
one that is wrong for such a chain; it is not changed here because that
is the shipped path and a question's wording is not worth a behaviour
change to it.

Held by `recover::tests::the_driver_escalates_onto_the_rung_above`,
which asserts the sentence for a two-tier chain.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let _ = attempts_on_rung;`

`attempts_on_rung` stays a parameter: it is what the caller has in
hand at the park, and dropping it would let a future caller pass a
number nothing reads. It is deliberately not what the human is told.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `attempts: total_attempts,`

The task's **total** attempts and the rungs they
spent, both derived from the fold, because that is what
the sentence the operator reads says: "N attempt(s)
across M rung(s) all failed". `attempts_on_rung` is this
rung's spend and is what the ladder reads; it is not what
the human is told.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn ladder_position(&self, key: TaskKey) -> Result<(u32, u32), UpstrokeError> {`

Where this task stands on its ladder: the rung its next attempt runs
at, and the attempts already spent there.

**Both from the fold, because a ladder position survives a resume.** A
settlement that escalates closes the generation and leaves the task
`Pending`, so this branch selects it again — and a driver that assumed
rung 0 would dispatch it at rung 0 forever, never reaching the tier its
chain escalated it to. A driver that assumed attempt 1 would hand
`next_step` the first attempt of the allowance every time, so the task
would retry forever and never escalate at all. Both were true of this
driver until `PR7-FOLD-LADDER-POSITION`.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn deferrals_recorded(&self, key: TaskKey) -> Result<u32, UpstrokeError> {`

How many times this task has already settled `Deferred`.

**The fold's count, not a tally this process kept.** `next_step` reads
it on the outage branch alone, and a process-local number agrees with
the log on every reading except the one after a resume — where it reads
zero while the log holds the deferrals, and the run defers past its
allowance forever.
`fold::tests::a_deferral_count_is_derived_by_replay_and_not_by_a_process_local_tally`
is the witness for that property.

**Witnessed at this level too.** The value is load-bearing only on the
outage branch — `next_step` ignores it otherwise, and so does
`settle_failed`, which reads `FinishedAttempt::defers` only to build
`SettlementTransition::Deferred` — so replacing this expression with a
constant zero once left the whole suite green.
`the_driver_settles_an_outage_from_the_folds_deferral_count` closes
that: it seeds one deferral in the log before the run, so the settlement
must record `defers: 2`, and the constant-zero mutation records `1`.
A prior deferral is what makes the read observable at all.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn ladder_policy(&self, key: TaskKey) -> Result<crate::ladder::LadderPolicy, UpstrokeError> {`

The frozen ladder's shape, as `next_step` reads it.

Every field from a record the run already froze: the entry's own ladder
for the allowance and the rung count, and `run_started(4).limits` for the
deferral ceiling. None of it is re-derived. With a validated override the
rung count is one: E2 binds every later attempt to the override, so there
is no rung above it to escalate onto.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn dispatch_request(`

What a first dispatch of `key` asks for, ordinary or repair.
`dispatch_kind` decides which: an entry with a lineage is a repair,
dispatched inside its root's lineage lease from the candidate the
latest `merge_rejected` registering it names (`rejected_source`), which
R11 keeps reachable for as long as the run can resume.

Every field is read from the run's own record, its log or the frozen
registry, never invented: the base is the run's current authorized
integration head and the predicted region is the task's `path_hints`.
**An empty hint list is `RepoWide`, not an empty prefix set** —
`PathSet::RepoWide` is documented as the classification for an absent
answer, and a task with no hints has given one. An empty `Prefixes` would
be a region that overlaps no bounded region, which would let every task
run against every other.

**The base is the head at dispatch, not the head the run started at.**
This read `run_started(4).base_sha` until the seventh repair round, which
was the same commit as the integration head at every dispatch of a run
that could not publish, and stopped being it the moment this slice made
publication real: a task dispatched after its dependency merged got a
worktree without the dependency's merged work in it
(`PR8-R7-DISPATCH-BASE`). [`super::integrate::dispatch_head`] answers with
the head the log's latest publication put there, having first confirmed
the integration ref is at it, so a foreign head refuses here — before the
reservation is taken, before `task_dispatched` is appended and before any
worktree exists.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `let paths = self.handle.fold.predicted_region(key).ok_or_else(|| {`

**The fold's answer, not a second one.** `dispatch_lease_check`
admitted this task by computing the region and asking the lease table
what it overlaps; recording a different region here would leave the
fold admitting on one answer and the log holding another, and the
log's is the one the lease table keeps. This module derived it
independently for exactly one commit, and took the plan's hints
literally where the fold strips globs to a literal prefix — so a hint
of `src/auth/*.rs` became a prefix that overlaps nothing while the
fold had admitted on `src/auth`.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn emit(`

Append one event through the run's own emitter.

Every append this type makes goes through [`RunEmitter`], which is
[`emit`] and nothing else. There is no second append path in this file
and there must not be one: three of this slice's findings were a second
implementation of this protocol.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `emitter`

The driver owns the ledger, so obligation (3) is discharged here
and the loop keeps one error type. `emitter` borrows the fold, the
log, the reservations and the warnings; `invocations` is a disjoint
field, which is the whole reason it is no longer inside `EmitState`.

## `struct IntegrationCx<'a, 'h> {`

The run's integration context: the emitter for the appends, the hook
bundle for the funnels, and the seams and ledgers the verification runs
through. One object, so `emit`, `verify` and `converted` are all `&mut
self` methods over disjoint fields rather than three overlapping borrows.

## `fn judge_proposal(&mut self, request: &VerifyRequest<'_>) -> Result<Judgement, JudgeError> {` › `let (diff_parent, diff_tree) = if request.already_present {`

The review diff: the proposal against the head for a stale
candidate, and the candidate's own patch (base..commit) for an
already-present one, whose proposal is the head itself.

## `fn judge_proposal(&mut self, request: &VerifyRequest<'_>) -> Result<Judgement, JudgeError> {` › `match crate::engine::classify::unjudgeable_diff(&diff, !plan.reviewers.is_empty()) {`

What the attempt path decides before it judges (`assess`), less the
Test-provenance rule: a diff no reviewer can judge — too large, or
opaque — and the review-input policy's answer for the proposed tree,
read in the staging worktree. Either stands in for the gates and
reviewers as the prior failure, and the sequence parks the candidate for
a person (R4): a Fix task cannot be asked to edit code without code
evidence, and waiting cannot make the same diff fit.

## `fn verify(&mut self, request: &VerifyRequest<'_>) -> Result<Verified, UpstrokeError> {` › `self.spend.record_reviews(key, &judgement.reviews);`

The ceiling's ledger, charged before the terminal is
appended, as an attempt's reviews are charged in `settle`:
`Spend::replay` rebuilds it from the terminal's record.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn answer_for(`

One reading of an answer, for every origin. A decline becomes
`Declined { decline_halts_run }` from the run's seam. For a
`HumanBinding` admission the answer must be one of the frozen options
(`chosen_index`, exact text), the option indexes the authorized agents
the fold kept beside the question, and the override is
`repair::one_off_binding`, derived once, here, at ingest (`R2`): the
repair ladder's frozen floor, pinned, the catalogue's lowest model for
that agent at or above the floor, the policy's effort for it. Text that
names no option is refused before anything is appended. Any other
origin records the chosen option index (0 for free text) and no
override.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn ingest_answer(`

Append `question_answered` for whichever origin `answer_for` read, and
report `Answered { declined }`. The fold does the routing: `AwaitingMerge`
for a verification park (the candidate re-verifies under a new
sequence), `Pending` for an admission, a failed lineage for a decline
with its queue position consumed and its lease released, halting per
`decline_halts_run`.

## `impl Verification for IntegrationCx<'_, '_> {` › `match self.judge_proposal(request, &mut charged) {`

The reviews are charged as each pass completes, inside `judge` (`SpendAccount`
below), and **not** from the judgement returned here: a judgement that fails
after a paid pass carries no reviews, and the Git-error arm settles the sequence
*unavailable* rather than ending the command, so the loop would go on to admit
another sequence in the same incarnation against a total that pass is missing
from.

`charged` is why that same failure no longer loses the record as well as the
judgement. The account fills it as it charges, so it holds every pass the
verification paid for whether or not a `Judgement` came back, and each
[`Verified::Unavailable`] arm carries it to the terminal. The list is the
account's, not the judgement's, which is the only reading under which the
unjudged arm has anything to record.

## `struct SpendAccount<'a> {`

The run's live account: each completed integration review is charged to the
run's `Spend` as it returns, so the ceiling the next selection is admitted
against has already paid for it. It also keeps the record it charged, in
`charged`, because the terminal that ends this verification has to carry the
same passes: without them a restart replayed a total without whatever a park or
an infrastructure deferral had already paid for, and the incarnation after the
restart admitted an integration the one before it refused
(`PR8-R2-SPEND-REPLAY`).

The seam takes the whole `ReviewRecord` rather than its cost for that reason,
and the charge happens where the record is built, before the ledger and
snapshot steps that can fail — so nothing is charged that is not also
retained, and nothing is retained that is not also charged.

## `struct OpenAsked {`

An open question as the loop reads it: the `Question` the answer source
sees, and beside it the key, the `QuestionOrigin` and — for a
`HumanBinding` admission — the authorized agents the fold froze, which
the chosen option indexes.

## `fn chosen_index(options: &[String], text: &str) -> Option<u32> {`

The option an answer's text names, by exact text. A one-off binding
activates only through an option the spawn froze, so anything else is
`None` and refused; for other origins `None` records index 0.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn ingest_answers(`

The non-blocking half of answer ingestion: every open question polled in
id order while the run is not ending, the first answer ingested through
`answer_for` and `ingest_answer`. `Ok(None)` when nothing has been
answered, and the step goes on to select.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn retry_materialization(&self, key: TaskKey) -> Option<Materialization> {`

What a same-generation retry records as its materialization: `Retained`
for a lineage member (the worktree keeps the pick the first attempt ran
on), `None` for an ordinary task. The fold requires the field present
exactly for lineage members.

## `impl TopologyRun` › `fn dispatch_kind(&self, key: TaskKey) -> Result<DispatchKind, UpstrokeError> {`

Ordinary or repair, from the frozen registry entry: an entry with no
lineage dispatches on its predicted region; one with a lineage is a
repair, executed inside the root's lineage lease from the candidate
`rejected_source` reads.

## `fn rejected_source(events: &[TopologyEvent], key: TaskKey) -> Result<CandidateRef, UpstrokeError> {`

The candidate a repair is materialized from: the latest `merge_rejected`
whose spawn registered `key`. Read from the log rather than kept on the
fold (a Class A reading: the fold's tables stay as PR8 froze them), and
refused when no rejection registered the key, since a repair with no
recorded source has nothing to run against.

## `pub(super) fn dispatched_source(`

The source a specific generation of a repair was dispatched with: its
own `task_dispatched`'s `source_candidate`. Recovery (g) and the
continuation both read this, so what is re-materialized is what the
interrupted dispatch materialized. Refused when the generation has no
dispatch or its dispatch names no source.
