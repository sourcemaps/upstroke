# `src/engine/topology/candidate.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/engine/topology/candidate.rs`](../../../../src/engine/topology/candidate.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does; this file is the whole of its prose, moved out of
the source verbatim. Each section is headed by the line of code the comment sat above, spelled
as it is in the source, so the heading is the grep string that finds the code.

## Module

The sequence from a judged tree to a queued candidate.

`decisions.workspace_candidates.candidate` gives the order, and it is the
whole of what this module is:

```text
hook-free commit-tree (Object.CandidateCommitTree: the commit is
  unreferenced Git/GC-owned residue, R27, until pinned; the parent-executed
  IdUnread point lies between the child's exit and the coordinator
  recording the id)
-> pin candidate-prepared/<key>/<gen> zero-old (R23)
-> append candidate_prepared (Promoting; candidate lease or lineage widening)
-> create candidates/<key>/<gen> zero-old (R11)
-> append task_candidate_created (queue position; Promoting ends; pipeline
   entitlement released)
-> prune the pin expected-old
```

…and then `cleanup`'s scrub: "task worktree scrubbed only after
`task_candidate_created` is durable or the generation is Closed".

Six steps, four ordering clauses — O28 commit object before pin with
`IdUnread` between, O29 pin before `candidate_prepared`, O30 the candidates
ref after `candidate_prepared` and before `task_candidate_created`, O31 pin
pruning and the forced scrub after `task_candidate_created`.

### The order is a typestate, not a comment

Each step takes the previous step's witness **by value** and returns its
own. [`UnpinnedCandidate`] is the only thing [`pin_candidate`] accepts,
[`PinnedCandidate`] the only thing [`append_candidate_prepared`] accepts,
and so on. A caller cannot append `candidate_prepared` for a commit it never
pinned, or create the candidates ref before the prepare, because there is no
value of the right type to pass. That is the shape
`crate::engine::topology`'s module documentation says three of this slice's
rules are being built into, and this is one of them.

The witnesses are also why the sequence is six functions rather than one:
every step is a separate obligation and a separate durable prefix, and the
fault matrix tables a resume action for each. None of them derives `Clone`:
a cloned [`PinnedCandidate`] is two `candidate_prepared` appends for one
pin, and a rule the fold has to catch at runtime is worse than one the type
checker refuses to compile.

### The settlement lands between step 2 and step 3, and is not this module's

There is no function here that runs the sequence from a tree to a queue
position, and that is not an omission.
`transaction_fault_matrix[T-CAND-OBJ]` puts the whole of steps 1 and 2 in a
window whose `durable_state` is "attempt_started only" and whose
`authoritative_state` is "**attempt unsettled**" — so the commit object and
its pin are written while the attempt is still unsettled, and the settlement
is `candidate_prepared` itself.

**This said `attempt_finished(succeeded)` is appended between the pin and
`candidate_prepared`, "which is what makes the generation `Promoting`".** It
is not, and since the 2026-08-27 CONFORM ruling the fold refuses that event:
`design/26_design_merge_queue_protocol.md` §26 makes
`candidate_prepared` the sole successful settlement for a candidate-producing
attempt and adds that `attempt_finished` "is not also emitted for that
attempt". `apply_candidate_prepared` is what promotes the generation.

That is the whole reason a resume in this window "settles attempt
interrupted" rather than promoting: there is no settled attempt to prepare a
candidate for, and the objects the run wrote are Git's.

[`promote`] therefore starts at the pin — steps 3 to 6, everything after
the settlement.

### Two claims this module exists to keep

**An unpinned candidate commit is never adopted.**
`transaction_fault_matrix[T-CAND-OBJ].resume_action` for the prefix where
the object exists and no pin does is "nothing to delete: the unpinned object
is left to Git (never adopted; decision:295)". [`recovery_for`] returns
[`CandidateRecovery`] with `settles_interrupted` set there, naming no object,
so there is no value a later step could adopt. The commit stays unreachable
and Git's garbage collector owns it (R27).

**The pin is pruned right after promotion; the candidates ref is not.**
`cleanup`: "candidate-prepared pins pruned right after promotion (or as
orphans); … candidates refs (R11) **never pruned while the run can
resume**, pruned only by Complete finalization, retained as forensic output
at Halted". So [`complete_promotion`] deletes the pin and nothing here ever
deletes a candidates ref.

### What guards these refs, and what does not

`transaction_fault_matrix[T-CAND-OBJ].refusal_condition` is "pin symbolic or
an unexpected ref under the run namespace". The first half is
[`WorkspaceManager`]'s: every ref primitive this module calls refuses a
symbolic name before touching it, which is `ref_rules`' "symbolic refs
refused". The second half needs a list somebody derived, and that is
[`expected_refs`].

`WorkspaceManager::assert_publishable` is **not** called here, and that is
not an omission. `decisions.workspace_candidates.integration_ref` is what
asks for it — "`refs/heads/upstroke/run-<id>` … `assert_publishable()`
before every prepare/CAS/recovery" — and its second conjunct, "is this ref
checked out in a worktree?", can only ever answer yes for a ref under
`refs/heads/`. Neither of this module's two refs is one, and neither is ever
checked out. Calling it would add a Git subprocess per candidate to answer a
question whose answer is fixed by where the ref lives.

### What "no production path" means here, precisely

`decisions.pr_sequence[8].production_effect` is "none", and that is true of
the **shipped binary**: `upstroke run` drives the legacy coordinator and
reaches nothing in this file.

It stopped being true as written. This section said "nothing here is a
production path yet … the schema-4 coordinator that will call them is the
rest of PR7", and that coordinator **arrived in this slice**:
`TopologyRun::promote_candidate` calls `write_candidate_commit`,
`pin_candidate`, `append_candidate_prepared`, `create_candidates_ref`,
`append_candidate_created` and `reclaim_after_creation`, and
`recover::finish_promotions` calls the last three. They are non-`#[cfg(test)]`
callers; what keeps the effect "none" is that `engine::topology` is
`pub(crate)` and no shipped command drives it, not that the callers do not
exist. Frontier review of `75da796`, finding 5.

## `pub const RUN_REF_ROOT: &str = "refs/upstroke/runs";`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The run ref namespace
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub const RUN_REF_ROOT: &str = "refs/upstroke/runs";`

The root every run-scoped engine ref hangs from.

`decisions.workspace_candidates.refs` writes all three of them under
`refs/upstroke/runs/<id>/`; the integration ref is the one that lives
elsewhere, under `refs/heads/`.

## `pub fn run_namespace(run_id: &str) -> String {`

The namespace of one run's refs, with the trailing separator a prefix match
needs.

The separator is not decoration: without it the namespace of run `abc` also
matches run `abcd`'s refs, and the unexpected-ref refusal would then read a
sibling run's namespace as this one's contamination.

## `pub fn candidate_pin_ref(run_id: &str, key: TaskKey, generation: GenerationId) -> GitRef {`

`refs/upstroke/runs/<id>/candidate-prepared/<key>/<gen>` — the pin (R23).

## `pub fn candidates_ref(run_id: &str, key: TaskKey, generation: GenerationId) -> GitRef {`

`refs/upstroke/runs/<id>/candidates/<key>/<gen>` — the authoritative ref
(R11).

## `pub struct CandidateNames {`

The two names one candidate takes, derived together.

**`<key>` is the numeric [`TaskKey`], not the task's display id.** Both
appear in the packet's examples, and only one of them is safe: a display id
comes from a plan file and may carry a `/`, a `..`, a trailing `.lock`, or
any of the other shapes `git check-ref-format` refuses, so a ref built from
one is a ref creation that fails on somebody's plan. `TaskKey` is a `u32`
and renders to digits, which are legal in every position of a ref. The fold
compares these names for equality and never parses them, so nothing downs-
tream depends on which of the two is used.

## `pub struct CandidateNames` › `pub prepared_ref: GitRef,`

The pin, R23.

## `pub struct CandidateNames` › `pub candidate_ref: GitRef,`

The authoritative ref, R11.

## `impl CandidateNames` › `pub fn of(run_id: &str, key: TaskKey, generation: GenerationId) -> Self {`

The names of one generation's candidate.

## `pub enum Refusal {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Refusals
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub enum Refusal {`

What this sequence refuses, as values rather than as prose.

`transaction_fault_matrix[T-CAND-OBJ].refusal_condition` is "pin symbolic or
an unexpected ref under the run namespace" — both of which
[`WorkspaceManager`] already owns — and
`transaction_fault_matrix[T-CAND-REF].refusal_condition` is "object missing
or different; ref present at another SHA", which is this enum.

## `pub enum Refusal` › `ObjectMissing {`

`T-CAND-REF`: "object missing".

## `pub enum Refusal` › `key: u32,`

The task.

## `pub enum Refusal` › `generation: u32,`

Its generation.

## `pub enum Refusal` › `commit: String,`

The commit the durable record names.

## `pub enum Refusal` › `RefAtAnotherSha {`

`T-CAND-REF`: "ref present at another SHA".

Serves both refs of the candidate sequence: the authoritative candidates
ref, which is never moved (R11), and the prepared **pin**, which binds to
the commit `candidate_prepared` recorded. A substituted pin refuses here
rather than being pruned, because deleting it is deleting the evidence
that it was substituted — DESIGN §15's "refuses while preserving
evidence".

## `pub enum Refusal` › `refname: String,`

The ref.

## `pub enum Refusal` › `found: String,`

What it points at now.

## `pub enum Refusal` › `expected: String,`

What the durable record says it must point at.

## `pub enum Refusal` › `MalformedCommit {`

A commit id that is not a full hexadecimal object id. Refused before any
ref primitive sees it, because `git update-ref` reads a short or
malformed value as a name to resolve rather than as an error.

## `pub enum Refusal` › `key: u32,`

The task.

## `pub enum Refusal` › `generation: u32,`

Its generation.

## `pub enum Refusal` › `value: String,`

The value as it was offered.

## `pub trait CandidateJournal {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The seam: the durable append
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub trait CandidateJournal {`

The one thing this sequence does not own.

`coordinator_integration.emit` is "build event → serialize → round-trip →
`plan_transition` → append the exact bytes through the Event funnel", and
the append-error protocol that guards it is `emit`'s, not this module's
(O17). So the two appends of the candidate sequence go through a seam, and
the coordinator's emitter is what satisfies it.

[`Self::fold`] is here rather than passed separately because every question
this module asks of live state — is this generation still `Promoting`? has
its `task_candidate_created` already landed? — is a question about the state
the emitter just folded. Two values that could disagree would be two
answers.

## `pub trait CandidateJournal` › `fn emit(&mut self, body: TopologyEventBody) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError>;`

Check, append durably, and fold `body`.

### Errors

A refused transition, or any failure of the append funnel.

## `pub trait CandidateJournal` › `fn fold(&self) -> &TopologyFold;`

The live fold, after everything this journal has emitted.

## `pub struct JudgedTree {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The witnesses
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub struct JudgedTree {`

What a judged tree hands the sequence.

Every field is a field of `candidate_prepared`
(`decisions.workspace_candidates.candidate`) except the two the sequence
derives for itself: `commit_sha`, which is what commit-tree prints, and
`parent_sha`, which is `base_sha` by `CandidatePrepared::parent_is_base` and
is therefore not a second input a caller could get wrong.

## `pub struct JudgedTree` › `pub key: TaskKey,`

The task.

## `pub struct JudgedTree` › `pub generation: GenerationId,`

Its generation.

## `pub struct JudgedTree` › `pub attempt: Box<AttemptRecord>,`

The attempt whose gates and reviewers judged this tree.

## `pub struct JudgedTree` › `pub base_sha: CommitSha,`

The commit the worktree was created at, and the commit the candidate is
parented on.

## `pub struct JudgedTree` › `pub tree_sha: CommitSha,`

The exact tree under judgment.

## `pub struct JudgedTree` › `pub message: String,`

The candidate commit's message.

## `pub struct JudgedTree` › `pub actual_paths: PathSet,`

The region the diff actually touched.

## `pub struct JudgedTree` › `pub lease_effect: CandidateLeaseEffect,`

What the candidate does to the generation's lease (INV-16).

## `pub struct UnpinnedCandidate {`

**Step 1 is done: the commit object exists and nothing references it.**

`resource_accounting[R27]`, and `candidate`'s own words: "the commit is
unreferenced Git/GC-owned residue, R27, until pinned". Dropping this value
without pinning is not a leak the engine has to clean up — it is the
tabled outcome, and Git's garbage collector owns what is left.

## `impl UnpinnedCandidate` › `pub fn commit_sha(&self) -> &CommitSha {`

The commit the coordinator recorded.

## `pub struct PinnedCandidate {`

**Step 2 is done: the pin exists (R23) and references the commit.**

## `pub struct PromotingCandidate {`

**Step 3 is done: `candidate_prepared` is durable and the generation is
`Promoting`.**

`candidate`: "a Promoting generation is always promoted before any
`run_finished`". This value is what the closure procedure at run end and the
resume in `transaction_fault_matrix[T-CAND-REF]` both hold — which is why
[`recovery_for`] hands one back rather than describing one.

## `pub struct PromotingCandidate` › `tree: CommitSha,`

The tree the attempt's gates and reviewers judged, from the durable
record. Carried beside the base because adoption checks both.

## `impl PromotingCandidate` › `pub fn candidate(&self) -> &CandidateRef {`

The candidate as the merge queue names it.

## `impl PromotingCandidate` › `pub fn prepared_ref(&self) -> &GitRef {`

The pin that is still holding the commit.

## `impl PromotingCandidate` › `pub fn base(&self) -> &CommitSha {`

The base the generation was dispatched at — the candidate's parent.

Carried alongside the candidate rather than re-derived because the
promotion is what verifies the object, and verifying it means comparing
it against the base the record already committed to. Both producers have
it in hand: the append built `parent_sha` from it, and the recovery reads
it off the durable `PreparedCandidate`.

## `impl PromotingCandidate` › `#[allow(dead_code)]` (trailing)

never called at 610106b; see `PR7-NARROWED-SURFACE-19-UNCALLED` (§2)

## `pub struct QueuedCandidate {`

**The sequence is done: the candidate holds a queue position, the pin is
pruned, and the task worktree is scrubbed.**

## `impl QueuedCandidate` › `pub fn candidate(&self) -> &CandidateRef {`

The candidate as the merge queue names it.

## `pub fn write_candidate_commit(`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sequence
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub fn write_candidate_commit(`

**O28, first half.** `Object.CandidateCommitTree`: write the candidate
commit.

The commit is unreferenced when this returns (R27), and the parent-executed
`IdUnread` point — the child exited with the object written, the coordinator
has not recorded the printed id — lies inside the funnel, between those two
facts. [`WorkspaceManager::candidate_commit_tree`] is what exposes it; this
function adds no point of its own, because a point the frozen inventory does
not declare is a coverage coordinate that measures nothing.

### Errors

A Git error from `commit-tree`, or an injected fault at the site.

## `pub fn pin_candidate(`

**O28, second half.** `Ref.PinCandidatePrepared`: pin the commit zero-old
(R23).

Zero-old and `--no-deref`, and a symbolic name refuses, because
`decisions.workspace_candidates.ref_rules` says every engine ref is created
that way and [`WorkspaceManager::create_ref_zero_old`] is where that lives.

### Errors

A symbolic pin, a pin that already exists, or a Git error.

## `pub fn append_candidate_prepared(`

**O29.** Append `candidate_prepared`, which is what makes the generation
`Promoting`.

The record is assembled here rather than by the caller for the reason
`parent_sha` exists at all: the fold refuses a candidate whose parent is not
the base its generation was dispatched at
(`CandidatePrepared::parent_is_base`), so the two fields move together or
not at all.

### Errors

A refused transition, or any failure of the append funnel.

## `tree: judged.tree_sha,`

The same value the event just recorded, so the live path and a resume
verify against one number rather than two that agree by inspection.

## `pub fn complete_promotion(`

**O30 and O31.** The rest of the sequence, and the only path to it.

This is `transaction_fault_matrix[T-CAND-REF].resume_action` verbatim —
"verify object; create exact candidates ref zero-old if absent; append
`task_candidate_created`; prune the pin (no spend repeats)" — followed by
`T-SCRUB`'s "idempotent contained forced removal of the worktree and
intent". The same sentence adds "the closure procedure performs the same
steps at any run end", so the live path and the resume path are one
function; there is no second one to drift from it.

Every step is therefore idempotent and reads the world before acting:

* the candidates ref is created only when absent, accepted when already at
  the recorded commit, and refused at any other (R11 is authoritative and is
  never moved);
* `task_candidate_created` is appended only while the generation is still
  `Promoting`, so a second call after a successful append is a no-op rather
  than a duplicate the fold would refuse;
* the pin is pruned expected-old only when it is present;
* the scrub is `WorkspaceManager::remove_worktree`, which is forced.

The candidates ref is **not** pruned here, at any run end.
`decisions.workspace_candidates.cleanup`: "candidates refs (R11) never
pruned while the run can resume, pruned only by Complete finalization,
retained as forensic output at Halted."

**Snapshots are not removed here either**, though `T-SCRUB`'s boundary
names them. `cleanup` gives them two mechanisms of their own — "snapshots
pruned on completion and reclaimed as residue" — and neither is this
function: a snapshot is pruned by the gate or review that finished with it,
and one left by a process that died is reclaimed from its intent by
[`WorkspaceManager::reclaim_intents`] at the next process start. That is
what `T-SCRUB`'s "snapshot intents reclaimed" names. Removing them from
here as well would be a second authority over the same rows.

### Errors

[`Refusal::ObjectMissing`], [`Refusal::RefAtAnotherSha`], a refused
transition, or a Git, I/O or append failure.

## `pub struct ReferencedCandidate {`

The candidate has its exact ref; `task_candidate_created` has not been
appended.

## `pub struct CreatedCandidate {`

`task_candidate_created` is durable; the pin and the worktree are not yet
reclaimed.

## `pub fn create_candidates_ref(`

**The effects half, before the append.** Verify the object, then create the
exact candidates ref zero-old if it is absent.

Split out of [`complete_promotion`] so a caller whose journal *is* its hooks
bundle can run the sequence at all. The three halves alternate between the
two — ref, append, reclaim — and a single `&mut dyn TopologyHooks` cannot be
held by the caller and by the journal at the same time. The typestate keeps
the order: nothing but this produces a [`ReferencedCandidate`], and nothing
but a [`ReferencedCandidate`] reaches the append.

### Errors

A missing or mismatched object, a ref already at another sha, or a Git error.

## `verify_object(manager, hooks.effects(), &candidate, &base, &tree)?;`

"verify object", its registry reads waiting through the settlement's hooks (the
follow-up B record's §9.13, R1).

## `match manager.direct_ref_target(candidate.candidate_ref.as_str())? {`

"create exact candidates ref zero-old if absent".

## `pub fn append_candidate_created(`

**The append half.** `task_candidate_created`, and nothing else.

Skipped when the generation has already left `Promoting`, which is the one
durable fact that says this append landed: `apply_candidate_created` closes
the generation.

### Errors

Whatever the journal returns.

## `pub fn reclaim_after_creation(`

**The reclaim half, after the append.** Prune the pin, then scrub the
worktree and its intent.

`side_effect_vs_event_ordering`: "pin pruning and scrub (forced) after
task_candidate_created". The typestate is what enforces that here — this
takes a [`CreatedCandidate`] and only [`append_candidate_created`] makes
one.

### Errors

A Git or I/O error from the prune or the scrub.

## `if let Some(found) = manager.direct_ref_target(prepared_ref.as_str())? {`

**"prune the pin" — expected-old against the *recorded* commit, not against
whatever is there.** This re-read the target and deleted that value, so a
pin substituted at any point before this line was removed with a
successful expected-old delete: the compare-and-swap compared the ref to
itself and could not fail. Deleting a substituted pin destroys the
evidence of the substitution, which is the opposite of what DESIGN §15
requires of an identity mismatch.

The candidate this reclaim is for is `created.candidate`, whose
`commit_sha` came from the durable record. That is what the pin must
point at, and it is what the delete compares against.

## `manager.remove_worktree(hooks.effects(), worktree)?;`

`cleanup`: the scrub, forced, and its intent with it.

## `pub fn promote(`

Steps 3 to 6: everything after the settlement, for a caller with nothing to
interpose between them.

There is deliberately **no** function that runs steps 1 to 6. The
generation's settlement lands between step 2 and step 3 and is not this
module's — see the module documentation.

### Errors

Any error of [`append_candidate_prepared`] or [`complete_promotion`].

## `pub struct OrphanPin {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recovery
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub struct OrphanPin {`

A pin that no `candidate_prepared` names.

`transaction_fault_matrix[T-CAND-OBJ].resume_action` (b): "delete the exact
orphan pin expected-old, after which the object is again Git's". *Exact* is
why the object it points at travels with the name: an expected-old delete
against a value the coordinator never read is an unconditional delete
wearing a conditional API.

## `pub struct OrphanPin` › `pub refname: GitRef,`

The pin.

## `pub struct OrphanPin` › `pub object: CommitSha,`

What it points at, read now.

## `pub struct CandidateRecovery {`

What the candidate sequence still owes one generation.

A product of three independent answers rather than one of three cases, and
that is deliberate. `transaction_fault_matrix` states *boundaries* — T-CAND-OBJ
(a) and (b), T-CAND-REF — and a boundary is a place a run can be
interrupted, not a partition of every state a run can be found in. A sum
type over the boundaries would have to answer for the states between them
(a promotion whose append landed and whose pin prune did not; a pin left by
a resume that was itself killed), and every one of those would arrive as a
new variant. These three fields are total over all of them.

## `pub struct CandidateRecovery` › `pub promotion: Option<PromotingCandidate>,`

`T-CAND-REF`: a promotion this generation has not finished.

`Some` while `candidate_prepared` is durable and either
`task_candidate_created` is not, or the pin it should have pruned is
still on disk. [`complete_promotion`] is what discharges it and is
idempotent, so both cases are the same answer rather than two.

## `pub struct CandidateRecovery` › `pub orphan_pin: Option<OrphanPin>,`

`T-CAND-OBJ` (b): a pin no durable record accounts for.

`Some` only while nothing durable names a candidate. Once
`candidate_prepared` is durable the pin is *accounted for*, and
[`complete_promotion`] prunes it in its place — a resume that pruned it
as an orphan would drop the commit's only reference before its
authoritative one exists.

## `pub struct CandidateRecovery` › `pub settles_interrupted: bool,`

`T-CAND-OBJ`: the attempt is unsettled, so the resume settles it
interrupted.

**Reported, not performed.** The settlement is O24's and belongs to
`settle.rs`; what this module knows is that the candidate sequence has
nothing to promote, which is the reason the attempt is settled that way
rather than by a success.

## `impl CandidateRecovery` › `pub const NOTHING: Self = Self {`

Nothing owed at all.

## `impl CandidateRecovery` › `pub fn is_empty(&self) -> bool {`

Nothing is owed.

## `pub fn recovery_for(`

Classify what one generation owes, from the derived state and the refs on
disk.

The fold is the input because the fold *is* the derived state — INV-02's
"live state and replay use one checked transition over the exact wire
event". A classifier that re-read `events.jsonl` for itself would be a
second derivation, and the two would answer differently exactly once.

The **last** generation is the one classified, not the open one. A promotion
whose `task_candidate_created` landed has already closed its generation, and
a coordinator killed between that append and the pin's pruning leaves a pin
behind a generation that is `Closed` — which a classifier that only looked
at open generations would report as owing nothing, forever.

### Errors

A Git error reading the pin.

## `return Ok(CandidateRecovery {`

Nothing durable names a candidate, so the pin — if the run left one
— is an orphan, and an attempt that was running is settled
interrupted.

## `if let Some(found) = pin.as_deref() {`

**The pin binds to the record.** `candidate_prepared` is durable and names
a commit; a pin present at any other object is a substitution, and DESIGN
§15's extended exact-identity rule refuses it rather than proceeding —
"any substituted or symbolic pin … refuses while preserving evidence".

This read the pin only as `pin.is_some()`, so a pin moved from the
recorded commit `C` to some `X` after `candidate_prepared` left the resume
promoting `C`, appending `task_candidate_created`, and then deleting the
substituted pin expected-old on the way out — succeeding, and erasing the
one ref that evidenced the substitution. The `bf927f3` review's second P1.

Refused **here**, before any effect: this is a predicate over the durable
record and one ref read, and a refusal belongs before the first append.
Nested rather than a let-chain: MSRV is 1.85 and let-chains are 1.88.

## `let unfinished = generation.class == GenerationClass::Promoting || pin.is_some();`

The promotion is unfinished while the queue position is missing, and also
while the pin it should have pruned is still there. The candidate's
identity comes from the durable record rather than from this module's own
derivation of the names, because the record is what the run actually
wrote.

## `pub fn prune_orphan_pin(`

Delete an orphan pin expected-old, after which its object is again Git's.

### Errors

A symbolic pin, an expected-old mismatch, or a Git error.

## `pub fn expected_refs(run_id: &str, fold: &TopologyFold) -> Vec<String> {`

Every ref this run is entitled to have under its own namespace.

`expected_failures_refusals[2]` and
`transaction_fault_matrix[T-CAND-OBJ].refusal_condition` both refuse "an
unexpected ref under the run namespace", and
[`WorkspaceManager::refuse_unexpected_refs`] performs the refusal — but only
against a list somebody derived. This is that derivation, and it comes from
the fold rather than from a walk of the refs themselves, so a ref with no
durable record behind it is exactly what fails.

**The pin is expected for every generation; the candidates ref only for a
generation that prepared one.** The asymmetry is the durable order. A pin is
written *before* anything records it — that is the whole of T-CAND-OBJ (b) —
so a list that expected a pin only where a record already names one would
refuse the run at exactly the prefix whose recovery is to prune it, and the
refusal would fire before the pruning could. A candidates ref has the
opposite order: `candidate_prepared` is durable before it is created, so
requiring the record costs a resume nothing and refuses a ref no candidate
ever justified.

The integration ref is absent because it lives under `refs/heads/`, outside
this namespace.

## `pub fn expected_refs(run_id: &str, fold: &TopologyFold) -> Vec<String> {` › `expected.push(names.candidate_ref.0);`

Created after `candidate_prepared` is durable, and never
pruned while the run can resume.

## `pub fn expected_refs(run_id: &str, fold: &TopologyFold) -> Vec<String> {` › `expected.push(names.prepared_ref.0);`

Written before any record of it, and pruned after promotion or
as an orphan.

## `fn is_promoting(fold: &TopologyFold, key: TaskKey, generation: GenerationId) -> bool {`

## `fn is_promoting(fold: &TopologyFold, key: TaskKey, generation: GenerationId) -> bool {`

Whether the generation that prepared `candidate` is still `Promoting`.

## `fn verify_object(`

`T-CAND-REF`'s "verify object", as the packet's own predicate.

`classify_object_residue` at `Object.CandidateCommitTree` with the recorded
id answers `After` exactly when that object is present — the site's after
phase is `AfterEffect::Unreferenced`, "the object is present and nothing
references it", and the classifier's `After` arm for the two commit-tree
sites is `object_exists` and nothing else. Reusing it rather than asking Git
again here keeps one answer to "is the candidate commit in this
repository?".

## `let parent = manager.commit_parent_pausing(effects, candidate.commit_sha.as_str())?;`

**Existence is not identity.** DESIGN.md §15: `candidate_prepared`
records the complete attempt/base/commit/tree identity "so resume adopts
only the judged object". Presence alone accepts any object that happens
to be at that sha — an unrelated commit, or a blob — which is exactly what
a resume must not adopt.

What is checkable here is what the fold keeps: the generation's base. A
candidate is a commit **on** that base, so an object that is not a commit
has no parent to read and one that is a different commit has the wrong
parent. Neither can pass.

## `let found = manager.commit_tree_sha_pausing(effects, candidate.commit_sha.as_str())?;`

**And the tree, which is what was actually judged.** The parent says the
commit sits where the work started; it says nothing about the content.
A commit with the recorded parent and a *different* tree used to pass
here — so a resume could create the authoritative candidate ref at an
object no gate ran against and no reviewer read, which is the one thing
§15's "adopts only that exact shape" exists to prevent. This comment used
to record that gap and call closing it "its own decision"; the decision
was made on 2026-08-26 (Class B, `reviews/FINDINGS.md` §3) and
`PreparedCandidate::tree_sha` is it.

Refused as `ObjectMissing` rather than a new refusal kind: the object at
that sha is not the candidate this run prepared, and "the candidate is
not here" is what that means for the caller. A new variant would be a
change to a refusal inventory this slice does not own.
