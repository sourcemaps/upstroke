# `src/engine/topology.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/engine/topology.rs`](../../../src/engine/topology.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does; this file is the whole of its prose, moved out of
the source verbatim. Each section is headed by the line of code the comment sat above, spelled
as it is in the source, so the heading is the grep string that finds the code.

## Module

`TopologyRun` — the schema-4 run lifecycle.

`decisions.sequential_substrate.engine`: "`src/engine/topology.rs`
TopologyRun drives schema 4 at max_parallel = 1 synchronously; every path
exists here before Tokio."

This module is the **conductor** of a schema-4 run. Almost nothing here is
new machinery: the event funnel and its stable-prefix barrier, the git
funnels of [`crate::workspace_manager`], the container census, and the
private-half ownership proof were all built and tested by PR4–PR6 and are
waiting for their first production caller. What arrives here is the
*ordering* over them — P0–P8, the recovery order, the candidate sequence —
and orderings are where this project's defects actually live: of 29
classified findings across PR3–PR6, `wrong_internal_assumption` is 48.3%,
three times `wrong_external_fact`.

That measurement is the argument for the shape this module is being built
into: a rule it could get wrong at runtime is preferably a rule the type
checker refuses to compile. Three such rules were named here. **One of them
is now written**: P0–P8 is a typestate, in `create`'s private `steps`
module — eleven witnesses from `PublicDirCreated` to `Started` beside the
`Facts` every prefix carries, each
constructor taking its predecessor by value, no field nameable outside the
module and no `Clone`, `Copy` or `Default` on any of them, so a step cannot
run out of order, run twice, or run on a witness whose step failed.

The other two are still **planned and not yet written**: a recovery order
that is a chain of witnesses each consuming the last — `RecoveryStep` is a
`Vec` pushed at runtime, which is a record of the order rather than an
enforcement of it — and a creator deletion boundary minted only from the
outcome of the step that could have crossed it, where
[`crate::rundir::CommitRecordPresence`] is derived by a `stat` after the
fact and says so in its own doc.

The two are stated in the future tense deliberately, and the first in the
past. A module comment that describes an intended shape as an existing one
is a false claim about the code, and this project treats that as a defect
rather than as optimism — but the converse is a defect too, and this
paragraph was one for as long as it said "none of them exists here today"
about a typestate the module below had already implemented.

### Nothing here is a production path yet

`decisions.pr_sequence[8].production_effect` is "none (TopologyPreview
selector only)". `upstroke run` still writes schema 3 and still drives
[`super::coordinator`]; a schema-4 run is reachable only from a
`#[cfg(test)]` writer selector. PR12 activates it.

## `#![cfg_attr(not(test), allow(dead_code))]`

**`dead_code` is allowed here for a lib build only, and the shape is the
point.** With `engine::topology` narrowed to `pub(crate)`, this subsystem has
no non-`#[cfg(test)]` caller — which is exactly what
`production_effect = "none"` asserts, and `pub` was what kept the compiler
from saying so. Narrowing it made rustc report **328 items** across this
module tree as never used.

`cfg_attr(not(test), …)` rather than a bare allow, deliberately. A blanket
`#![allow(dead_code)]` would hide a genuinely dead item added later, which is
the class this slice's own review rounds kept finding. Under this form the
**test** build carries no allow, so anything not reached even by a test is
still an error at `-D warnings`. What is silenced is precisely the one true
fact — the production binary does not drive schema 4 yet.

**Remove this when PR12 activates the driver.** At that point the items have
production callers and the allow stops being true rather than stops being
convenient.

## `#![deny(`

**The topology subtree's effect denials, restated at its root rather than
inherited from the crate's defaults.** Since #306 (`PR7-WRAPPERS-EMPTY-DOMAIN`)
the parent, `src/engine/mod.rs`, carries `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]`
as a row of `effects/allowlist.toml`'s legacy section, because the v0.1
conductor's entry points it calls are denied effectful wrappers. A lint level
is scoped by the module tree, not the file: without this line that allow
would reach all forty files under `engine::topology`, none of which writes an
attribute of its own, and the placement scan
(`every_allow_of_a_governed_lint_is_module_level_and_in_the_allowlist`) would
never see it, because it records what a file writes. This `deny` overrides
the inherited level for the whole subtree. It changes nothing on its own --
the three lints were already errors under `-D warnings` -- and it is the
whole difference between "topology is denied" and "topology is exempt": it
must land in the same commit as the parent's allow, never separately.
Deny-at-module is the established form (`connect/render.rs`,
`status/render.rs`, `util/terminal.rs`, `validate/graph.rs`,
`validate/render.rs`), and a `deny` needs no allowlist row, since the scan
records only `allow` and `expect`. An attribute somebody can delete is a
weaker guarantee than the absence of an allow was, so
`effects::tests::the_topology_root_re_denies_every_lint_the_engine_facade_allows`
holds it: it reads both files and refuses a missing or narrowed deny, and it
compiles the shape -- the facade's allow, this deny, a child reaching one
denied primitive per lint -- against the real denylist, beside the same shape
without the deny, in which the child's reach into a denied wrapper goes
unrefused.

## `pub mod preflight;`

The schema-4 attempt-plan assembler, which lives engine-side.

Re-exported here rather than from the `engine` facade, whose contents are
enumerated by the packet and asserted by
`the_engine_facade_exposes_exactly_the_items_the_packet_enumerates`. This is
schema-4 vocabulary, and this module is where the schema-4 vocabulary is.

It is engine-side rather than here for the reason [`attempt::AttemptPlans`]
exists at all: building a plan materializes the permissions file that
defines the attempt's sandbox, and a topology module may not be allowlisted
for that write.

## `pub mod preflight;`

**The schema-4 facade's re-exports, reduced to the ones the crate uses.**

This file carried ~45 lines of `pub use` flattening every submodule's types
into `engine::topology::*`. Narrowing `engine::topology` to `pub(crate)` made
rustc report almost all of them **unused**: nothing in the crate used the
shortened path — callers name `topology::attempt::AttemptPlan` and so on
directly — so they existed to populate a public path that should not have
existed. `pub` was hiding dead code, which is the second thing the frontier
review's finding 1 bought.

What remains below is exactly what a compile with `-D warnings` says is
reached, derived by deleting the block and re-adding only the names that
failed to resolve. Deleted rather than `#[allow]`-ed: an allow hides the same
dead code one level in.

Seven names were reached, all from test modules through the flattened path.
What remains of the block is the three module declarations it enclosed.

## `mod scaffold;`

**No re-exports at all, and the last attempt is why.** Gating the seven
test-reached names with `#[cfg(test)]` put a `#[cfg(test)]` in front of a
`pub use` rather than a `mod`, which truncates this file's
`effects::production_region` at that line — and everything below a cut is
invisible to every census consulting that region, silently.
`effects::tests::every_production_region_that_stops_early_stops_at_a_module`
pins the ten files whose cut lands on something that is not a module, its doc
says "this file is not one of them and must not become one", and it caught
this within one `cargo test`. The seven call sites name their submodule
directly instead.

## `mod scaffold;`

The schema-4 run that `dispatch.rs` and `attempt.rs` are tested against.

One fixture for both, because the two halves of one lifecycle are tested
against one run: an attempt test needs a dispatched generation and a
dispatch test needs the attempt that never started. Declared here rather
than under either module for the same reason.

**Private, and declared last.** Private because a module's own descendants
can see it — `dispatch::tests` and `attempt::tests` both are — so a `pub`
qualifier would widen it for nothing.

It would no longer *hide* it. `effects::census_domain` used to recognise a
whole-file test module by the literal text `#[cfg(test)] mod `, and a
visibility qualifier written between the two halves defeated that rule
silently; it reads the item structurally now, so `pub(crate) mod scaffold;`
would resolve here exactly as the private form does. The qualifier is still
not written, because widening for nothing is the thing being avoided and
not the census.

Last because `effects::production_region` cuts a file at its first
`#[cfg(test)]`, and a declaration higher up would take the re-exports above
it out of every census that reads that region.
