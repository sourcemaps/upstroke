# `src/lib.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/lib.rs`](../../src/lib.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does; this file is the whole of its prose, moved out of
the source verbatim. Each section is headed by the line of code the comment sat above, spelled
as it is in the source, so the heading is the grep string that finds the code.

## Module

v0.1 scope (DESIGN.md §21, steps 1–10): parse an annotated markdown plan
into the IR, resolve a routing chain per task, and execute it sequentially —
one agent subprocess per attempt, gates and read-only review over the
engine-captured diff, one commit per task, every transition an event in
`events.jsonl`. `resume`, `status`, and `answer` are folds over that log.

The capacity engine (§13) ships **read-only**: `connect` discovers the agent
CLIs and writes the pools file, `capacity` and the dry-run preview estimate
what is left and what each strategy *would* do, and budgets stop a run at a
ceiling — but nothing routes on any of it. Capacity-driven binding is v0.2.

## Held to declarations

This file declares the crate's modules and nothing else, and since #318's
third round `effects::tests::a_declaring_module_holds_declarations_and_re_exports_and_nothing_else`
holds it to that shape beside `src/engine/mod.rs`: a `fn`, a constant, an
inline module, `include!` or a macro written here is a red test. The reason
is the lint level: every allowance in the crate sits below this file, so it
can neither `forbid` a governed lint (`E0453` at the first allowance) nor
usefully `deny` one (a `deny` is a level an inner `allow` lowers), and a
file that states nothing and holds no code hosts nothing -- which is what
`every_unclassified_production_file_states_each_governed_lint_or_inherits_its_forbid`
takes as the reason to pass over it.
