# `src/effects/tests/source_oracles.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/effects/tests/source_oracles.rs`](../../../../src/effects/tests/source_oracles.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does. These notes started as the module's source prose.
Each code fragment in a heading is an exact source substring. When a heading names an enclosing
item before `›`, find that item first, then the following fragment within it.

## Module

The **source oracles**: the sixteen checks that hold this crate's own lexical
instruments against the tree they read.

Four instruments, and every whole-tree census in this repository is built on
one of them: [`crate::effects::blank_comments`] and
[`crate::effects::blank_comments_and_strings`] decide what a census can
*see*, [`crate::effects::production_region`] and
[`crate::effects::production_code`] decide what it is allowed to *count*,
and `census_domain::whole_file_test_modules` decides which files it skips
entirely. A defect in any of them is silent by construction — the census
stays green and its count is simply lower — so these twelve drive each
instrument with input that reaches its failure path rather than measuring it
only on compliant input.

The two site censuses at the top are here for the same reason and not a
different one: both answer a question about *source text* — a `row()` arm
that is a wildcard, a topology module naming a funnel in production — and
both would report silence rather than failure if the region they scan had
collapsed. Each carries its own non-vacuity control, and those controls are
what tie them to this file rather than to the inventory they read.

Everything they read with stays where it was. The tree readers
(`scanned_sources`, `repo_root`) are `super`'s, and the instruments
themselves are `crate::effects`'. This file consumes them; it re-derives
none of them, and it defines no region of its own — which is what
`every_early_stop_is_at_a_module` counts two lines from its end.

**No name here is a test name.** The twelve `#[test]` wrappers stay in
`super` under the harness names the contract, CI and `reviews/FINDINGS.md`
know, and the sixteen functions below are deliberately named otherwise — so
every name `--list` reports for this file is one of those wrappers and
nothing nests under `effects::tests::source_oracles`. `effects/wrappers.toml` names
`no_topology_module_calls_a_funnel_in_production` and `reviews/FINDINGS.md`
names three more; all four still resolve, because the harness did not move.

### Why the bodies sit inside a `cfg(test)` module

The reason `classification.rs` records, and here it is load-bearing twice
over rather than once. A file reached by a plain `mod` declaration is inside
every whole-tree census's domain, and the bodies below are an unusually rich
source of census needles: a table of funnel prefixes, a `RunnerRequest {`
quoted in prose, and the container-runtime literal three censuses in this
crate count files by. The inline module closes it for both source cutters at
once — [`crate::effects::production_region`] truncates at the first
`#[cfg(test)]` and [`crate::effects::production_code`] excises the item that
attribute attaches to — so none of those needles is in any census's region,
and this file reads as the test logic it is.

It does so **without moving the whole-file module census**.
`census_domain::declared_whole_file_test_modules` derives a skip only from a
**terminated** declaration -- `mod name;` -- whose effective predicate
entails `cfg(test)`, and `super` declares this file with a plain `mod` at
its own top level: no attribute, and no inline `cfg(test)` ancestor in the
file that writes the declaration. The derivation deliberately does not close
over the file graph, so `super` being a test module itself does not make
this one. No skip is derived and no file leaves any census. That matters
more here than anywhere else in this directory:
`the_whole_file_modules_are_read_from_the_declarations` is one of the sixteen
bodies below, and a declaration written the other way would make this file a
member of the very set it is itself asserting the membership of.

That terminated form is deliberately not spelled out here, for the reason
`policy.rs` gives: one written inside a comment is the exact shape that once
derived a phantom skip and removed a real file from every census below it,
and the blanking that now defeats it is not a reason to write another.

The `#![deny]` below deliberately stays **above** the cut. Blanking takes
the prose, so that attribute is all three whole-tree walks' per-file "this
region is empty" control has left to count here — and a region that
collapses to nothing is exactly what that control exists to catch.

The three effect denials are **restored** rather than inherited. `super`
allows them because it drives a compiler over fixtures it creates; nothing
in this file does — every body below reads the tree and writes nothing — so
the allowance has no business reaching it. That is also what keeps this
module out of `effects/allowlist.toml`: an allowance is what that file
records, and this module takes none.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `fn declared_production_children(`

The production module rooted at `declared_in`'s **declarations**: each
non-test `mod <name>;` it writes, with the two files that name can
resolve to.

Derived rather than enumerated, for the reason
[`crate::effects::census_domain::declared_whole_file_test_modules`] gives
at length. A `read_dir` filtered to `*.rs` entries gets a census domain
wrong in both directions at once: a child written in the `<name>/mod.rs`
layout is a *directory* entry and is skipped, and a `#[cfg(test)] mod
row_cases;` child carries its `cfg` on the **declaration**, so
[`production_region`] cannot cut it out of `row_cases.rs` and a stem that
is not exactly `tests` is scanned as production.

**What was checked about the machinery this reuses**, rather than assumed
from the fact that it exists:

* [`scan_module_declarations`] reads a file's module *structure* — brace
  depth, the inline modules open at each point, and the `cfg` on each of
  them — over [`crate::effects::blank_comments_and_strings`], so a `mod`
  written in prose or in a string is spaces. That is what a text rule
  gets wrong, and `policy.rs` records a phantom skip once derived from a
  declaration written inside a comment.
* [`candidates_for`] names both out-of-line layouts and folds the inline
  path into the directory. It refuses a `#[path]` attribute rather than
  resolving it, which is the one construct that could point a declaration
  outside its own directory.
* [`sole_present`] refuses zero candidates and refuses two, rather than
  picking one. A domain that cannot name the file a declaration resolves
  to is not a domain.
* **The one thing the scan does not decide**, and it is a hole rather
  than a choice: a `cfg_attr` that applies a `cfg` is invisible to it, so
  `#[cfg_attr(all(), cfg(test))] mod hidden;` reads as unconditional.
  This walk is the first caller whose answer depends on that
  classification, so it is the change that would activate the hole —
  and [`refuse_unclassifiable_cfg_attr`] stops the walk on one rather
  than classifying it. The reasoning is there.
* **The limitation that does *not* transfer.**
  `declared_whole_file_test_modules` deliberately does not close over the
  file graph, because there closing would *remove* a dozen files from
  every census's domain — a change to what every census can see. Here the
  walk below closes over production declarations, which only *adds* files
  to one census. Opposite direction, so the precedent's reason not to does
  not apply.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `fn declared_children(declared_in: &Path, source: &str) -> Vec<(String, [PathBuf; 2], bool)> {`

Every `mod <name>;` the file writes, production and test-only alike, with
the two files the name can resolve to and which kind it is.

The test-only half is not part of any census domain. It is here because
the **reconciliation** needs it: a `.rs` file under the module's
directory is legitimate when *some* declaration accounts for it, and
`tests.rs` is accounted for by a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`. Without that
half the reconciliation would refuse the one file the split is required
to leave behind.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `fn refuse_unclassifiable_cfg_attr(declared_in: &Path, source: &str) {`

Stop, rather than classify, when a file writes a `cfg_attr` that could
apply a `cfg`.

[`scan_module_declarations`] treats a `cfg_attr` as significant only when
it mentions `path` (`src/effects.rs`), so
`#[cfg_attr(all(), cfg(test))] mod row_cases;` — which rustc applies as
`#[cfg(test)]` and compiles only under `test` — is read there as an
unconditional declaration. `declared_whole_file_test_modules` records the
hole at length and calls it a hole rather than a choice.

**Which censuses it can reach is decided here.** Before this walk existed,
the row-mapping census read one file named by a literal and derived no
domain at all, so no `cfg_attr` anywhere could change what it scanned.
A walk that sorts declarations into production and test-only is the first
reader of that classification, and so is the change that would put the
hole in reach: a test-only child read as production drops a file of
legitimate test code into a census that rejects a wildcard `row()` arm.

**The scan is not widened to close it.** What [`scan_module_declarations`]
decides is what every census in this crate measures; teaching it to
evaluate `cfg_attr` predicates changes all of them at once and is its own
change with its own review — the disposition
`declared_whole_file_test_modules` records for exactly this. So the walk
refuses instead, in the direction every `ScanRefusal` variant takes: a
scan that cannot say what a file declares must not answer.

The test is the scan's own `"cfg_attr" if raw.contains("path")` shape read
for `cfg` rather than for `path`, and it is deliberately coarser than the
attribute-to-item association that deciding this properly would need —
that association *is* the widening. Any `cfg_attr` whose attribute could
apply a `cfg` stops the walk, whether or not it sits on a `mod`.
Over-refusal is the safe direction, and its cost here is measured rather
than assumed: no file of the `topology::effects` module writes a
`cfg_attr` at all, and no `cfg_attr` **attribute** anywhere in this crate
is of the refused form — every one of them conditions an `allow` or a
`path`. So the walk refuses nothing on this tree, and part (3) of the
witness is what keeps saying so: it walks the real module, and a
`cfg_attr` added to any file of it stops that test rather than quietly
changing what the census counts.

Comments and string literals are blanked first, so the `cfg_attr` written
in the prose above is spaces by the time it is looked for. That is the
defence `policy.rs` records a phantom skip for the want of.

### Panics

When `source` writes such an attribute. Driven, with a control that the
same declaration without it is classified, by
`the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module` part (4).

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `mod domain {`

The privacy boundary that makes the row-mapping census's domain
*provably* the walk's output. It holds nothing else.

## `mod domain` › `pub(super) struct ProductionModule {`

Every file of the production module rooted at one file — the root,
and transitively each file its production `mod <name>;` declarations
resolve to — each with the source the walk read for it.

Transitive because a domain is the module, not its first level: a
`row()` mapping in `effects/sites/worktree.rs` is as much inside
`topology::effects` as one in `effects/sites.rs`. Bounded by the
visited set rather than by a depth limit — candidates descend into
directories, so the relation is a forest and a cycle is unreachable,
which is the reason to hold the set rather than a reason to trust the
shape.

**A type rather than a `Vec<PathBuf>`, because the census's domain has
to be provably this walk's output, and a list of paths is a value any
caller can equally well write down by hand.** On this tree the two are
indistinguishable *by value*: the module's seven production children
are all flat `.rs` files, so a hard-coded list of the current eight
paths and the derived domain are the same eight paths in the same
order, and no assertion comparing values can tell a census that walks
from one that enumerates. Two successive repairs tried to close that
by counting the call lexically; a reviewer twice showed the same
substitution walking through it — keep the call, bind its result to
`_`, scan a hard-coded list instead, and there is still exactly one
call and no `read_dir`.

So the difference is made a *type* error instead. [`Self::walk`] is
the only constructor, `sources` is private to this module, and the
scan is [`Self::row_mapping_wildcards`], a method over source text
only the walk can put in the struct. Under that substitution there is
no `ProductionModule` to call the scan on, and the census does not
compile.

**The type closes the substitution and not the sibling.** A census
that keeps the walk, keeps the call, and takes its answer from a
helper beside it that reads the files itself compiles perfectly well,
and no assertion whose domain is the census's *source text* sees it —
which is the bypass two lexical repairs were shown to admit. That one
is closed by [`RowMappingScan::scanned`]: the scan records the path of
every file it read, the census asserts that collection is
[`Self::files`], and a helper's stale eight against the walk's nine
fails on a set difference rather than on a name.

## `impl ProductionModule` › `pub(super) fn walk(root: &Path) -> Self {`

Walk the production module rooted at `root`.

### Panics

When a declared child cannot be read or cannot be resolved to
exactly one file on disk, and when the walk returns nothing but
the file it was handed.

## `pub(super) fn walk(root: &Path) -> Self` › `test_owned.insert(module_dir(&resolved));`

A test-only child owns its own subtree. Its files
are not production and are not this domain's, so
the reconciliation prunes there rather than
descending into test code to account for them.

## `pub(super) fn walk(root: &Path) -> Self` › `assert!(`

**The control that binds every caller**, placed here rather
than at each of them, for the reason the
`census_domain::declared_whole_file_test_modules` and
`census_domain::whole_file_test_modules` notes give in
[`docs/internals/effects.md`](../../effects.md). A walk that found nothing but the file
it was handed is a domain that has stopped meaning anything,
and no caller can hold a `ProductionModule` without having
come through this line.

## `impl ProductionModule` › `pub(super) fn sources_for_witness(&self) -> Vec<(PathBuf, String)> {`

The walked files with the source the walk read, for the one
witness that drives [`refuse_macro_declared_modules`] against
the real module. Not a way to obtain the domain: the census
takes its scan from [`Self::row_mapping_wildcards`], and a
caller holding this still cannot construct a [`RowMappingScan`].

## `impl ProductionModule` › `pub(super) fn files(&self) -> Vec<PathBuf> {`

The domain, sorted.

## `impl ProductionModule` › `pub(super) fn row_mapping_wildcards(&self) -> RowMappingScan {`

Scan the module's production regions for `row()` mappings.

**Returns the path of every file it read.** That is what lets a
caller state its domain as a claim about *values* rather than
about its own source text; see [`RowMappingScan`].

## `pub(super) fn row_mapping_wildcards(&self) -> RowMappingScan` › `let body_end = rest.find("\n    }").unwrap_or(rest.len());`

The body runs to the closing brace of the `match`,
which is the first line at the function's own
indentation that is exactly `    }`.

## `pub(super) fn row_mapping_wildcards(&self) -> RowMappingScan` › `scan.scanned.push((path.clone(), mappings));`

One entry per file of the domain, whether or not it held a
mapping, pushed at the end of the iteration that read it —
so the collection cannot be anything but the set this loop
walked.

## `mod domain` › `pub(super) fn module_dir(file: &Path) -> PathBuf {`

The directory a module owns: `x/foo.rs` owns `x/foo/`, and
`x/foo/mod.rs` owns `x/foo/`.

## `mod domain` › `pub(super) fn refuse_unaccounted_files(`

Refuse a `.rs` file under the module's own directory that **no
declaration accounts for**.

The domain stays *declared*, not enumerated — this does not add the
directory to it, and a file found here is a refusal rather than a new
member. What it closes is the direction a declaration scan cannot see
on its own: [`scan_module_declarations`] reads an item-position macro
invocation's **tokens**, and a macro whose body lives in a file the
walk never reads expands to `mod twelfth;` while its invocation site
shows nothing module-shaped. The walk then stays at eight paths and
every value assertion above it still holds, because they all agree
about a domain that is quietly one file short.

Reproduced before this existed: `macro_rules! declare_twelfth` in
`src/topology/mod.rs`, `declare_twelfth!();` in `effects.rs`, and a
wildcard `row()` in `effects/twelfth/mod.rs` — both row-mapping tests
green, no test file touched, the wildcard missed. The scanner is not
widened to evaluate macro expansion: that would change what every
census in this crate measures, which is the disposition
`declared_whole_file_test_modules` records. This refuses instead,
which is the direction every `ScanRefusal` variant takes.

A test-only child owns its own subtree and is pruned rather than
descended into: its files are not production, so accounting for them
would mean reading test code to decide something no census asks.

### Panics

When such a file exists. Driven in both directions, with the real
module and a deliberately incomplete accounting, by
`the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module` part (7).

## `mod domain` › `fn item_position_macros(blanked: &str) -> Vec<(usize, String)> {`

Every item-position macro invocation in `source`, as (line, name).

Item position, not expression position: `const _: () = assert!(..)`
is a macro at brace depth 0 and is **not** an item, so the character
before the name decides. `;`, `}` and `]` (an attribute) precede an
item; anything else is an expression context.

## `fn item_position_macros(blanked: &str) -> Vec<(usize, String)> {` › `let mut after = at + 1;`

A delimiter after the `!` is what makes this an
invocation rather than `macro_rules! name {` or `!=`.

## `mod domain` › `pub(super) fn refuse_macro_declared_modules(sources: &[(PathBuf, String)]) {`

Refuse an item-position macro invocation whose `macro_rules!` the
walk cannot read.

**This is the half [`refuse_unaccounted_files`] cannot reach.** That
one reconciles the module's own directory, so it catches a hidden
child that lands *inside* it. A macro expanding to
`#[path = "effects_hidden.rs"] mod hidden;` puts the file beside the
module rather than under it, and no directory walk rooted at the
module finds it. Reported by the sixth frontier pass on `27c8b2b`,
with a sequence that preserves behaviour while it hides: move
`EventSite::row` into the hidden file and write `_ => ResourceRow::R21`,
which every current variant already maps to, so eleven mappings
remain and the floor still passes.

**Why the definition's location is the right test.** The hole is a
macro whose *expansion* the walk cannot see. When the `macro_rules!`
is itself in one of the walked files, the walk does see it, and
`scan_module_declarations` already refuses any macro body holding a
module-shaped token sequence (`ScanRefusal::ModuleShapedMacroBody`).
So an in-domain macro cannot hide a module, and one defined anywhere
else cannot be ruled out from here. The refusal is exactly the
second case.

Its cost on this tree is **zero, measured rather than assumed**: the
module writes one item-position invocation, `const_identity_walk!`
at `src/topology/effects.rs:619`, and its `macro_rules!` is at
`:599` in the same file.

**What it does not close.** An in-domain macro that itself invokes an
out-of-domain macro, and any expansion produced by a procedural
macro, whose body is not token trees this crate can read at all.
Neither is reachable on this tree — the module uses no proc macro at
item position — and both would need the scanner to evaluate
expansion, which is the widening this file declines for the reason
`declared_whole_file_test_modules` records.

### Panics

When such an invocation exists. Driven in both directions by
`the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module` part (8).

## `mod domain` › `pub(super) struct RowMappingScan {`

What [`ProductionModule::row_mapping_wildcards`] read, and what it
found in it.

**`scanned` is the half that makes the census's domain checkable.**
Until it existed, whether the census scanned the walk's output was
answerable only by reading the census's *source* — first by counting
its call to the scan, then by banning the names that can obtain
source text — and a reviewer walked through both forms the same way:
a sibling helper that scans a stale list of paths leaves the census's
own body innocent of every needle, so the assertion's domain (that
body) was never the claim's domain (the files the census reads).

Recording the paths moves the question to run time. A caller compares
[`Self::paths`] with [`ProductionModule::files`], and a scan that read
eight files while the walk produced nine fails on the set difference.

**The fields are private to this module and there is no constructor,
so that comparison cannot be handed forged operands.** The first
version of this type exposed both fields `pub(super)`, and a reviewer
showed the equality still bypassable: a sibling helper scans the
stale eight, then builds a `RowMappingScan` whose `scanned` is copied
from `ProductionModule::files()` with a zero count for the ninth path
it never read. The equality then compares the walk against **the
helper's own report of what it read**, which is not evidence about
what it read, and the wildcard in the unscanned child is missed with
both tests green. That was measured, not argued: the bypass passed at
`6dc5987`.

It is the same defect as the lexical witness this type replaced, one
level down — an assertion whose stated domain (the files scanned) is
wider than the domain it counts (the files *reported*) — so the
repair is the one `CODING_STANDARDS.md` prescribes under
"Representing state": keep fields private when construction must
preserve an invariant, and do not expose a representation and ask
callers to behave. [`ProductionModule::row_mapping_wildcards`] is now
the only expression in the crate that can produce this value, and it
is a method on a type only [`ProductionModule::walk`] constructs.

## `pub(super) struct RowMappingScan` › `scanned: Vec<(PathBuf, usize)>,`

Every file the scan read, in the order the walk sorted them, with
the number of `row()` mappings found in its production region.

A file holding no mapping is still an entry: this is the
**domain**, not the hits. On this tree six of the eight hold
none, so the distinction is measured rather than stipulated —
`the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module` part (5)
is where.

## `pub(super) struct RowMappingScan` › `offenders: Vec<String>,`

Every mapping that falls back through a wildcard arm, named by
the file it was found in.

## `impl RowMappingScan` › `pub(super) fn paths(&self) -> Vec<PathBuf> {`

The files the scan read, in walk order.

## `impl RowMappingScan` › `pub(super) fn mappings(&self) -> usize {`

How many `row()` mappings were found across all of them.

## `impl RowMappingScan` › `pub(super) fn read_without_a_mapping(&self) -> Vec<&PathBuf> {`

The files that were read and held no mapping.

The control that keeps [`Self::paths`] from being a tautology:
non-empty on the real module, so the recorded collection is
demonstrably the domain and not the hits.

## `impl RowMappingScan` › `pub(super) fn offenders(&self) -> &[String] {`

Every mapping that falls back through a wildcard arm.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `fn item_body(source: &str, signature: &str) -> String {`

The body of the item whose signature line contains `signature`, read out
of `source` with comments and string literals blanked.

Blanked, because the question every caller asks is what the code *does*,
and a name written in a doc comment beside it is not a call. Blanking is
length-preserving, so the braces this matches are the braces the compiler
sees.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `fn panic_message(body: impl FnOnce()) -> Option<String> {`

Run `body`, returning its panic message if it panicked.

**The panic hook is deliberately left alone**, for the reason
`workspace_manager::tests::panic_message` gives at length: the hook is
process-global and these tests run in parallel, so two of them swapping it
out and back can interleave and leave the process running with a no-op
hook for good. A few lines of expected noise on stderr is the cheaper
half of that trade.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn site_row_mappings_have_no_wildcard_arm() {`

Every site enum's `row()` is **exhaustive by construction**: no wildcard
arm (`PR5-EVENTS-063`, and the other half of `PR5-WORKSPACE-049`).

`expected_failures_refusals[7]` is "a site without a row mapping fails to
compile", and today that holds only as a *side effect* of `row()` happening
to be written out arm by arm. Nothing asserted the absence of a wildcard,
and the control measured what one costs: with `EventSite::row`'s single
explicit arm replaced by `_ => ResourceRow::R21`, adding an unmapped variant
produced ten `E0004` non-exhaustive errors and `row()` was **not** among
them — the wildcard had silenced exactly the diagnostic the sentence refers
to, and the whole suite stayed green.

A source census rather than a compile fixture because it is the *absence* of
a construct that has to be checked, and a fixture can only demonstrate that
something fails to compile today. The `topology::effects` inventory is
frozen in the sense that matters here — its seventy sites and their
mappings are PR3's and no slice adds to them — so this scan guards a
property no slice may change, whatever file the mappings sit in. They
have not always sat in one: the module was split into per-concern
children, which is what the domain below is derived rather than
enumerated for.

The mappings live in a **module** rather than a file since
`topology::effects` was split into per-concern child modules:
`EffectSiteId::row` stayed in the root and the eleven site enums' went to
`sites.rs`. So the domain is a [`ProductionModule`] — a path here names a
module, not a file — and
`the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module` is what measures
membership in it, in both directions.

**The domain is bound to the walk here, over values.** The scan returns
the path of every file it read, and the first assertion below is that
that collection *is* [`ProductionModule::files`]. Two earlier repairs
asserted the same intent over this function's **source text** — one
counted the call, one banned the names that can open a file — and both
were bypassed the same way, by a sibling helper that scans a stale list
of paths and leaves this body innocent. A set difference does not care
what the body says: a helper scanning yesterday's eight files while the
walk produces nine fails on the ninth path.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn site_row_mappings_have_no_wildcard_arm() {` › `let scanned: Vec<PathBuf> = scan.paths();`

THE DOMAIN, ASSERTED OVER VALUES: what was read equals what the walk
produced. Not "the body of this function names no reader" — that is a
claim about this text, and a helper beside it reading a stale list of
paths satisfies it while scanning the wrong set.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {`

The `row()` census's domain is the **declared** production module, and
membership in it is measured in both directions.

The two witnesses the first repoint carried measured neither. Planting a
wildcard in `vocab.rs` proves that one already-included flat file is
scanned; filtering the walk to nothing proves that the count floor fires.
Both are true of a domain that is simply the wrong set. What follows
drives the membership rule itself, and it writes nothing: this module
restores the three effect denials (`#![deny]` above), so a fixture tree on
disk is not available to it and is not needed.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let synthetic =`

(1) DECLARED, NOT ENUMERATED, and both out-of-line layouts are named.
The declaring file is the real one — only the text is synthetic — so
the directory the candidates are resolved in is the real one too.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let lib = repo_root().join("src/lib.rs");`

(2) AND THE `mod.rs` CANDIDATE IS THE ONE THAT RESOLVES when it is the
one on disk. Measured on a real directory-layout module of this crate:
`src/topology.rs` does not exist and `src/topology/mod.rs` does.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let module = ProductionModule::walk(&effects);`

(3) THE REAL DOMAIN, named file by file — and `tests.rs` is outside it
because its declaration carries `#[cfg(test)]`, not because of its stem.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `expected.sort();`

Sorted the same way the walk sorts, so the assertion is about the set
and not about the order these eight were typed in: `PathBuf` orders by
component, so `effects` precedes `effects.rs`.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let refusal = panic_message(|| {`

(4) A DECLARATION THE SCAN CANNOT CLASSIFY STOPS THE WALK.

`scan_module_declarations` does not decide a `cfg_attr` that applies a
`cfg`, and the walk above is the first reader of its production /
test-only classification — so this walk is what would put that hole in
reach of the census, and `refuse_unclassifiable_cfg_attr` is what keeps
it out. Driven here rather than argued, because a refusal nothing
exercises is the same silence it exists to break.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `assert_eq!(`

The control: the refusal is the attribute, not the declaration under
it. Without the `cfg_attr` the same `mod hidden;` classifies as
production and the walk carries on.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let scan = module.row_mapping_wildcards();`

(5) AND THE CENSUS'S DOMAIN IS A CLAIM ABOUT VALUES.

Parts (1) to (4) test the walk. They cannot say whether the census
uses it. Two repairs answered that lexically — count the census's call
to the scan, then ban the names that can obtain source text — and a
reviewer walked through both, for the same reason each time: **the
domain of a lexical assertion is the census's source text, and the
claim is about the files the census reads.** A sibling helper that
scans a stale list of paths satisfies every such assertion while
scanning the wrong set, and no further needle reaches it, because the
reading it has to catch is not in the text it looks at.

So the claim is made where it can be made over values.
`site_row_mappings_have_no_wildcard_arm` asserts that the paths
`RowMappingScan::scanned` recorded *are* `ProductionModule::files`;
a helper that scans eight files while the walk produces nine fails on
the ninth path, whatever its body says.

What this part measures is the property that assertion rests on, which
nothing else states: **the recorded collection is the domain, not the
hits.** Six of the module's eight files hold no `row()` at all — every
mapping is in the root and in `sites.rs` — so a scan that recorded
only the files it found something in would record two paths, and the
census's equality would fail on the honest tree. That is also the
stale-helper shape exactly: a helper reports the set it looked at, and
the set it looked at is the wrong one.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let owned: BTreeSet<PathBuf> = [repo_root().join("src/topology/effects/tests")]`

(7) AND A FILE NO DECLARATION ACCOUNTS FOR STOPS THE WALK.

Parts (1) to (5) all reason from the declarations. None of them can
see a declaration the scan cannot read, and there is one:
`scan_module_declarations` reads an item-position macro invocation's
*tokens*, so a macro whose body lives in a file the walk never reads
expands to `mod twelfth;` while its invocation shows nothing
module-shaped. Reproduced before the refusal existed — the macro in
`src/topology/mod.rs`, the invocation in `effects.rs`, a wildcard
`row()` in `effects/twelfth/mod.rs` — and **both row-mapping tests
stayed green with no test file touched**. Every assertion above agreed
about a domain one file short, which is what makes it invisible from
inside the declarations.

`refuse_unaccounted_files` reconciles the declared set against the
module's own directory. The domain is still declared: a file found
here is a refusal, never a new member.

Driven with the real module and no fixture tree, because this module
restores the three effect denials and writes nothing. The accounting
is the input, so both directions are reachable by varying it.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `refuse_unaccounted_files(&effects, &accounted, &owned);`

The honest accounting refuses nothing — the control, and it is what
says the refusal below is about the missing entry rather than about
the directory being unreadable or the pruning being wrong.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let mut short = accounted.clone();`

Drop one file from the accounting and it is named. That is exactly
the shape a macro-declared child presents: on disk, in no declaration.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let mut without_tests = accounted.clone();`

And the test-only prune is load-bearing, not decoration: without it
`tests.rs` is a `.rs` file under the directory that the PRODUCTION
accounting does not hold, so the reconciliation would refuse the one
file every split of this shape is required to leave behind.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let hidden = repo_root().join("src/topology/effects.rs");`

(8) AND A MACRO THE WALK CANNOT READ STOPS IT TOO.

Part (7) reconciles the module's own DIRECTORY, so it catches a hidden
child that lands inside it. A macro expanding to
`#[path = "effects_hidden.rs"] mod hidden;` puts the file beside the
module instead, where no directory walk rooted at the module finds it
— the sixth pass's finding, with a sequence that preserves behaviour
while it hides: `EventSite::row` moved into the hidden file with
`_ => ResourceRow::R21`, which every current variant already maps to.

The test is where the `macro_rules!` lives, not whether a macro is
present. A macro defined in a walked file is one the walk reads, and
`scan_module_declarations` already refuses a module-shaped body there;
one defined anywhere else cannot be ruled out from here. Synthetic
sources, because the input is a list of (path, source) pairs and both
directions are reachable by varying it.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `refuse_macro_declared_modules(&[`

THE CONTROL THAT MAKES IT THE DEFINITION'S LOCATION AND NOT THE MACRO:
the same invocation passes once the definition is in the walked set,
because then the scan reads the body and refuses a module-shaped one
itself.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `refuse_macro_declared_modules(&[(hidden, "const _: () = assert!(true);\n".to_owned())]);`

And an expression-position macro is not an item: this is what keeps
the refusal's cost at zero on a module that writes
`const _: () = assert!(...)`.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `refuse_macro_declared_modules(&module.sources_for_witness());`

The real module refuses nothing — measured, not assumed. Its one
item-position invocation is `const_identity_walk!`, defined in the
same file.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let this_file = fs::read_to_string(repo_root().join("src/effects/tests/source_oracles.rs"))`

(6) BELT AND BRACES: THE CENSUS'S OWN BODY NAMES NO READER.

**The domain of this part is the census's text, and so is its claim.**
It does not establish (5)'s property and is not written as though it
did — a helper beside the census leaves this body innocent, which is
why (5) exists and why a seventh needle would not help. What it closes
is the cheap form, an edit that opens a file inside the census itself:
it fails one step earlier than the set difference would, naming the
construct rather than a set of paths. It bans constructs rather than
counting a name, so unlike a call count it has no near-miss to slip
through. Needles are matched with comments and string literals
blanked, so one written in prose or in an assertion message is spaces
by the time it is looked for.

The other half of the old part (5) is the compiler's and stays there:
`sources` is private to `domain`, `walk` is its only constructor and
the scan is a method on it, so a census that keeps the call, binds it
to `_` and scans a hard-coded list has nothing to call the scan on and
does not compile.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `assert!(`

Non-vacuity, both directions: `offenders` is code inside the census,
and `sole_present` is code inside the walk and inside part (2) above,
so its absence is what says the extractor stopped at the census's own
closing brace instead of running on through the file.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_row_mapping_census_domain_is_the_declared_module() {` › `let own = item_body(`

And the needle set can fire at all: this witness's own body reads a
file, and the same extractor over the same needles finds it. Without
this, six needles that matched nothing would read exactly like six
needles that found nothing to match.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn topology_production_names_no_funnel() {`

`decisions.pr_sequence[6].scope` ends "no topology production callers", and
`non_goals[0]` is "production topology callers".

The census is over the **production region** of every topology module, and it
carries its own control: the test region of `src/topology/registry.rs` DOES
name a funnel, so a census whose region split had collapsed to the empty
string would fail here rather than report "nobody calls anything".

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn topology_production_names_no_funnel() {` › `if !is_topology || !path.starts_with("src/topology/") {`

`src/workspace_manager.rs` and `src/runner/**` are in
`TOPOLOGY_MODULES` because the legacy section may not contain them;
they are the funnels themselves and naturally name funnels.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn topology_production_names_no_funnel() {` › `let registry = fs::read_to_string(repo_root().join("src/topology/registry.rs"))`

The control.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_reachable_fn_parser_finds_every_shape() {`

The scan's own parser, on this tree's real shapes.

`externally_reachable_fns` decides the classification domain, so a parser
that quietly saw half the tree would make [`every_externally_reachable_fn_of_a_legacy_or_shared_module_is_classified`]
pass against a domain nobody drew — the omission failure this project's
reconciliation table exists for, one level down.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_reachable_fn_parser_finds_every_shape() {` › `assert!(!found.contains(&"private".to_owned()));`

Twenty-two shapes accepted, six refused, and five of the six are refused for
five different reasons: private, private-in-an-inherent-impl, test region, a
trait method DECLARATION (no body to classify — its implementations are
reached by the `impl … for …` shape), and a default body in a trait that
is not itself visible.

Six of the twenty-two were outside the domain, or in it under another name,
until round 3 of #309. A method of `impl Trait for [u8; 4]` and a public
trait's default body returning `[u8; 4]`: `find_header_brace` stopped at the
`;` inside the brackets, so the impl gave no span and the body was taken for a
declaration. A name after a comment, after a line break, a non-ASCII name and
a raw identifier: `declared_fns` read `fn`, one space and ASCII, so the first
three were unread and `r#raw_identifier` was `r`. The sixth refusal is the one
that must stay one: a macro's `fn $name` is not a name
(`docs/internals/effects.md` has each measurement: no name moved at that head).

Four of the twenty-two are round 4's, and they are about a keyword that
touches what follows it, which rustc allows wherever the next token is not
part of a word: `impl<T> Glued<T>for Thing<T>`, `impl::path::Trait for Thing`
and `impl Trait for&'static str` are trait impls, and until then the `impl`
reader wanted a separator or `<` after `impl` and the `for` reader a separator
on each side, so their methods were outside the domain. The fourth is the
price, pinned so that it is a decision: `impl<F: for<'a> Fn(&'a u8)> Holder<F>`
is an inherent impl whose header holds the word `for`, it reads as a trait
impl, and its private `behind_a_bound` is in the domain. That costs a row and
fails closed; telling a bound's `for` from the impl's cannot be done by the
next token (`impl Tr for <X as Y>::Out` is a trait impl), and the tree holds
no such header -- no name moved.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_reachable_fn_parser_finds_every_shape() {` › `for separator in RUSTC_WHITESPACE {`

The eleven separators rustc reads, each written after `fn`, after `trait`,
after `impl` and on both sides of `for`: the free function, the default body
and the trait impl's method are all in the domain, each counted once. Before
round 4 of #309 the name reader read nine of the eleven (not U+200E, not
U+200F) and the `trait`, `impl` and `for` readers read exactly one, U+0020;
they read a keyword as a whole word now and ask nothing of what follows it.
The last assertion hands the name reader a text no tokenizer has rewritten,
because through `externally_reachable_fns` the tokenizer has already written
the six separators a library predicate can miss as spaces, and a reader that
went back to `char::is_whitespace` would pass every other row.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_reachable_fn_parser_finds_every_shape() {` › `let exploit = concat!(`

`PR6-LANEF-007`, stated as the reviewer's own exploit: a default body on a
public trait that reaches an effect. The parser used to answer
`visible || in_trait_impl`, and a default body is neither — so the body
below was outside the classification domain of a CLASSIFIED module, and
clippy, all 79 effects tests and all 38 container tests passed with it in
the tree. It is in the domain now, which means somebody has to classify it.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_domain_reaches_past_a_configured_item() {`

The shape `PR7-WRAPPERS-EMPTY-DOMAIN` measured in six classified modules: a
`#[cfg(test)] use` among the imports, every production `pub fn` below it.
Under the truncating region the fixture derived nothing, and an empty derived
set is equal to an empty record, so `reachable_fns_are_classified` passed
over a module it had not read. The fixture also carries the three test-only
shapes `production_code` must still remove -- a configured `pub fn`, a
configured `impl` block (the `src/agent/bin.rs` shape) and a configured
`mod` -- so the repair is pinned from both sides: the production `pub(super)
fn` and the trait-impl `fmt` are derived, the three test-only names are not.
Fails at the head before the repair with `derived: []`.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn every_classified_module_that_declares_a_visible_fn_has_a_domain() {`

The same defect on the tree rather than on a fixture, in three parts. The
six modules the finding measured are pinned by name, so the empty-domain
shape cannot return silently in the files it was found in. Then every entry
of `CLASSIFIED_MODULES` whose production code spells `pub fn `,
`pub(crate) fn ` or `pub(super) fn ` must derive at least one name -- a
lexical sufficient condition, deliberately not a second parser: any of those
three spellings in the blanked production code is a visible fn whatever
else the file holds, and the count of such modules is asserted above forty
so the scan cannot pass by finding nothing. Last, `src/rundir/names.rs`, the
one classified module whose record is all-empty legitimately: it declares
constants and no `fn` at all, and both halves of that are asserted, so a fn
added there without a row fails here before it fails the classification
census with a less specific message.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_comment_blanker_models_raw_strings() {`

The comment blanker models raw strings, so an unparsed literal cannot erase
a later one.

`PR6-LANEF-005`. [`blank_comments`] used to track only `"`, and documented
the omission as safe because "the failure mode is a needle this function does
not find … loud rather than accept something extra". **For a census over an
expected set that is backwards**: a missed needle is a false negative, the
computed set stays equal to the expected one, and the census is green with a
file it should have caught. `every_declared_effect_denial_names_a_real_path`'s
"docker invocation helpers" block is exactly such a census, and the reviewer
measured it staying green with an extra Docker-naming file present.

The two axes: {construct} × {is a later literal on the same line still
visible}. Every row keeps a real comment invisible, so this cannot pass by
the blanker having stopped blanking.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_comment_blanker_models_raw_strings() {` › `let exploit = r####"const A: &str = r#"x" //"#; const B: &str = "docker";"####;`

The reviewer's shape: a raw string whose body contains a quote and a `//`,
with a real literal after it on the same line.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_comment_blanker_models_raw_strings() {` › `for (label, source) in [`

Every other literal shape, each with a live needle after it.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_comment_blanker_models_raw_strings() {` › `for source in [`

And a real comment is still removed — in both flavours, and a doc comment
quoting a needle is still invisible, which is `PR4-CENSUS-COMMENT-ORACLE`.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_comment_blanker_models_raw_strings() {` › `let counted = "// one\n/* two\nthree */\nlet b = 1;\n";`

Line breaks survive, because callers report line numbers.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_notes_give_each_blanker_its_own_contract() {`

The two blankers have two different contracts, and
[`docs/internals/effects.md`](../../effects.md) states each one under the
function it belongs to.

`PR161-ASTRA-BLANKER-CONTRACT`. The notes opened [`blank_comments`] with its
sibling's contract — "every comment and string literal replaced by spaces of
the same length" — while the function deletes a comment's bytes and keeps a
literal's. A census written from that sentence can look for a needle inside a
literal that is no longer there, or report a line and column measured against
an input the output is no longer aligned to.

The notes are read with `\r\n` folded to `\n` first. A Windows checkout under
`core.autocrlf` hands the file back with carriage returns, and the heading and
fence boundaries this parser looks for are spelled with bare newlines: without
the fold every section lookup misses and the test fails on the guest while
passing on Linux.

Prose cannot be pinned by naming the sentence it must not contain, so the
direction of every assertion here is measured first: which helper preserves
its input's length is computed from the helper, and the notes are then
required to say so for that one and not for the other. The worked example
under each heading is parsed out and run, so an example that stops matching
its function fails by value rather than by wording.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_notes_give_each_blanker_its_own_contract() {` › `let (deleting_in, deleting_out) = worked_example(&deleting, DELETING);`

The example is the notes' own, not a copy of it kept here: a drift between
the two documents cannot hide behind a fixture this test owns.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_notes_give_each_blanker_its_own_contract() {` › `for claim in LENGTH_CLAIMS {`

Both length claims, each required in exactly the section whose helper the
measurement above says holds it.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn a_multi_byte_char_literal_keeps_the_blankers_phase() {`

A char literal whose scalar is more than one byte does not desync the
tokeniser.

`PR7-R2C-CHAR-LITERAL-DESYNC`. Both blankers decided "is this a char
literal?" with a fixed two-byte lookahead, so `'é'` — whose closing quote is
at `+3` — was classified as **not** one, scanning resumed *on that closing
quote*, and the quote was read as an opening one. From there the pairing is
shifted by one and a `{` that is inside a char literal survives into the
blanked text as visible code.

One unbalanced brace was enough to take a whole file out of every census:
`matching` counts it, `configured_item_end`'s brace arm walks past the item's
real `}`, and giving up used to mean "blank to end of file". The last block
below is that attack, in miniature. Full size, on `src/agent/claude.rs`, the
region measured **8525** non-whitespace bytes with the attack and 8525
without it — a zero-byte delta, invisible to every byte floor in this crate,
which is why the repair is in the tokeniser and in the give-up direction
rather than in a floor. Gate-clean, with the probe written as
`stringify! { ('é','{') }` (rustfmt leaves brace-delimited macro bodies
alone; it rewrites the bare tuple to `('é', '{')`, and the space defuses it)
inside `src/runner/container/view.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)] pub(crate) mod
fixtures`, a forged `RunnerRequest {` builder above that file's real test
module passed `every_production_runner_request_is_built_by_its_roles_builder`
with `cargo fmt --check` and `clippy -D warnings` both at exit 0 — and failed
it by name with the probe removed.

The preconditions are already here: `src/status.rs`, `src/util.rs` (twice on
one line) and `src/engine/tests.rs` hold non-ASCII char literals today. Only
the adjacency was missing.

Two axes: {scalar width} × {what follows the literal}. The controls are the
lifetime rows — a blanker that treated every `'` as a literal would pass the
leak rows and fail those.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn a_multi_byte_char_literal_keeps_the_blankers_phase() {` › `for (label, source, leaked) in [`

1. The tokeniser. Nothing inside a char literal reaches the blanked text.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn a_multi_byte_char_literal_keeps_the_blankers_phase() {` › `for lifetime in [`

The controls. A lifetime is not a char literal, and a blanker that said
"yes" to every `'` would blank from the tick to the next one — taking the
signature with it.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn a_multi_byte_char_literal_keeps_the_blankers_phase() {` › `let kept = "const P: (char, char) = ('é','{');\nlet q = '😀';\nlet r = '—';\n";`

And its sibling, which KEEPS literals instead of blanking them, is driven
over the same shapes. Its failure mode is the opposite one — it can only
lose bytes — so what it must do is leave a comment-free source alone and
still remove the comment after a multi-byte literal. Measured over all 92
source files, its output is byte-identical before and after this repair;
both blankers consult one scanner, which is what keeps it that way.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn a_multi_byte_char_literal_keeps_the_blankers_phase() {` › `let attacked = "fn above() {}\n\`

2. The same defect through `production_code`, end to end. Production
   above, an inline test module holding the pair, production below — the
   exact geometry of `src/agent/claude.rs`.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn an_unfindable_item_end_blanks_the_attribute() {`

A region that cannot find where an item ends blanks the attribute, not the
file.

The second half of `PR7-R2C-CHAR-LITERAL-DESYNC`, and the half that decides
how much a desync costs. `configured_item_end` has two give-up paths — an
unbalanced brace and an item with no terminator before end of file — and both
used to return `bytes.len()`, which [`production_code`] reads as "the item is
the rest of the file" and blanks. That converts a tokeniser that has lost
phase into **silence**: every production item below the attribute leaves
every census that consults this region, and the census reports zero
offenders.

They return `start` now. The test module reads as production, the counts go
up rather than down, and a census that pins an expected set fails by name.
Neither path is reachable from this tree as it stands — measured, zero
occurrences over all 92 source files — so this drives them with input that
does reach them, which is the only way a give-up path is ever seen.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn an_unfindable_item_end_blanks_the_attribute() {` › `let region = production_code("fn above() {}\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\nfn below() {}\n");`

An unbalanced brace: `mod tests {` never closes.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn an_unfindable_item_end_blanks_the_attribute() {` › `let region = production_code("fn above() {}\n#[cfg(test)]\nuse a::b\n");`

An item with no terminator before end of file.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn an_unfindable_item_end_blanks_the_attribute() {` › `let region =`

The control: when the item *does* close, it is still removed in full.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_file_modules_are_read_from_the_declarations() {`

**The whole-file test modules a census skips are the crate's own
declarations, structurally resolved — not a file-name rule.**

The class boundary for `PR7-R5-ATT-001`. Four whole-tree censuses skip test
files; three took the set from
[`census_domain::declared_whole_file_test_modules`] and one wrote its own
rule, `path.file_stem() == "tests"`. That covers the entries of
[`WHOLE_FILE_TEST_MODULES`] whose file stem is `tests` — the ones a
literal `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` declares. The crate declares six
more, and they are exactly the ones a census is most likely to trip over
— a scaffold, a fake, a fixture and a readiness protocol exist to *name*
what production names, and `scaffold.rs` sits inside the
`engine/topology` domain one of those censuses walks.

`agent/proc/test_support/readiness.rs` is the last of them and the one no
**text** rule finds at all: it is declared `pub(crate) mod readiness;`,
with no attribute of its own, inside `proc`'s inline `#[cfg(test)]
pub(crate) mod test_support { … }`. Nothing in that file is
`#[cfg(test)]`, so a census that did not skip it would read 500 lines of
fixture — five denied effect calls among them — as production.

**Every module named, not counted.** A count alone passes when the
derivation swaps one file for another — same cardinality, different set
— and names alone pass when it grows one more nobody looked at.
[`WHOLE_FILE_TEST_MODULES`] is the census domain as a list of paths, so
comparing against it refuses both, and refuses them by naming the file
gained or lost rather than by printing two integers.

**It pins identity, not independence.** What compares against that list
is one resolver read two ways and a file-name rule, not three separate
derivations, and a declaration form the resolver cannot see is missing
from all of them at once. The comment on the second half of the body
says which is which and names the form this scan misses.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_file_modules_are_read_from_the_declarations() {` › `fn relative<'a>(root: &std::path::Path, path: &'a std::path::Path) -> &'a std::path::Path {`

**Identity is a `Path`, never a string.** `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §8:
a lossy display string is for diagnostics only, never identity.
`to_string_lossy` maps two distinct non-UTF-8 paths onto one, and
rewriting `\` to `/` turns a backslash -- a legal character in a Unix
file name -- into what reads as a separator, so an equality over the
rendered text can answer about a file that is not the one on disk.
`Path` compares component-wise and Windows accepts either separator,
so the forward-slash literals of `WHOLE_FILE_TEST_MODULES` match a
native path with no conversion at all. The one lossy rendering left
below is `declaring`, which is interpolated into a message and
compared with nothing; do not fold the two back together.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_file_modules_are_read_from_the_declarations() {` › `fn sorted(mut paths: Vec<&std::path::Path>) -> Vec<&std::path::Path> {`

Both sides of every comparison are sorted the same way, so no
comparison depends on the order the list happens to be written in and
a failure names the offending file rather than printing two integers.
Sorting both is what makes that safe: `Path` orders component-wise,
which ranks `a.rs` after `a/b.rs` where a byte sort of the same text
does the reverse. No pair of entries differs that way *today*; a
slice adding one that did would otherwise fail here on ordering while
the set was right. A `Vec` rather than a set, so a duplicated entry
fails instead of being absorbed.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_file_modules_are_read_from_the_declarations() {` › `let expected = sorted(`

The expected value, and the two halves of it the rules below
partition into. `WHOLE_FILE_TEST_MODULES` holds `PathBuf`s relative
to `src`, which is what `relative` produces, so this borrows them as
paths and converts nothing. Filtering a sorted list keeps it sorted,
so the halves need no second sort.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_file_modules_are_read_from_the_declarations() {` › `let declarations =`

**The two halves of `WHOLE_FILE_TEST_MODULES`, separated.** The
comparison above is satisfied by any derivation that reaches this
set; these two say *how* each file was reached, which is the part the
structural scan changed. The `tests.rs` half comes from a literal
`#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` — the form a text rule could find — and
the derivation must still find all of those after learning to read
structure, because a scan that resolved ancestry and lost the plain
case would trade one blind spot for another.

**What reading one list buys, and what it does not.** These four
comparisons are not four independent derivations, and this test does
not claim they are. `whole_file_test_modules` calls
`declared_whole_file_test_modules` and resolves each declaration it
returns to a file, so `resolved` above and `declared` below are two
views over **one** resolver; `named` and `literal` are those same two
views filtered, one by the file-name rule `file_stem == "tests"` and
one by the declaration form. The file-name rule is the only genuinely
separate derivation here. What the list buys is identity — a module
swapped for another, renamed, added or dropped fails a comparison by
name rather than by cardinality — and what comparing the two halves
buys is the disagreement between the file-name rule and the
declaration form: a file called `tests.rs` that no literal
declaration reaches, a literal declaration resolving to a file not
called `tests.rs`, or a `tests.rs` whose declaration is guarded by
something narrower than `test` — present on the file-name side,
absent from the declaration side, and the one of the three that
silently costs a platform its test module — splits the halves apart
and fails.

**The blind spot is shared, and it is not hypothetical.** A
declaration form the resolver cannot see is missing from all of this
at once — from both views, from both filters, and from the list,
which is maintained by hand from the same derivation. PR #101's
reviewer produced one and it reproduces: `#[cfg_attr(all(),
cfg(test))] mod hidden_tests;` is applied by rustc as `#[cfg(test)]`,
but `census_domain::scan_module_declarations` treats a `cfg_attr` as
significant only when it contains `path`, so it reads that
declaration as unconditional and omits the file. It is a stated limit
of the domain, recorded on
`census_domain::declared_whole_file_test_modules`. The gap predates
this change; widening the scan is its own change with its own review.

Reading one expected value from the list is therefore not duplication
to restore. Writing the population out four times would add no
derivation and close no blind spot, and it would restore what PR
#97's review found: the same two counts were stated as English words
37 times across ten files, so one slice adding a module falsified
every one of them at once while the `>=` floor stayed green.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_file_modules_are_read_from_the_declarations() {` › `fn declared_file<'a>(`

Each declaration named by the file it resolves to, through the shared
resolver rather than a second copy of the rule
(`PR5D-VISIBILITY-CHECK-DUPLICATED`), so this comparison is in the
same terms as the list.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_file_modules_are_read_from_the_declarations() {` › `let is_literal = |declaration: &crate::effects::census_domain::TestModuleDeclaration| {`

**Membership is the declaration form, guard included.** This read
only the name and the inline path until PR #101's second pass, which
is a rule that never looked at `guard` though it is right there:
`#[cfg(all(test, unix))] mod tests;` still entails `test`, still
resolves to a file called `tests.rs`, and passed as the plain form
while Windows compiled no such module at all. The rule is
`is_the_literal_mod_tests_form`, shared with the fixture that drives
it over synthetic input, because a second copy here is the defect
`PR5D-VISIBILITY-CHECK-DUPLICATED` names.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_file_modules_are_read_from_the_declarations() {` › `let declaring: Vec<String> = declarations`

Diagnostics, not identity: this names the files those declarations
were *written in*, for the failure message, and is compared with
nothing. §8 allows a lossy rendering here and only here.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_file_modules_are_read_from_the_declarations() {` › `let inherited: Vec<(&std::path::Path, String, Vec<String>, String)> = declarations`

And the one that is reached only through an inline ancestor, named
with the ancestry it was reached through. This is the whole of what
the structural scan buys, so it is asserted as a value rather than as
a count.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_configured_item_is_removed_and_the_rest_kept() {`

[`production_code`] removes the item and keeps the file.

Every shape here is one this tree actually contains, and each is a way a
truncating region loses production code. The censuses that use this helper
count over the whole tree, so a shape it mishandles is a hole nobody would
see: the count would simply be lower.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_configured_item_is_removed_and_the_rest_kept() {` › `let region = production_code("fn above() {}\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests;\nfn below() {}\n");`

A `mod tests;` declaration. The files that declare a whole-file
test module named `tests` — the `tests.rs` entries of
`WHOLE_FILE_TEST_MODULES` — end with one, and everything below it
used to be outside every region that truncates.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_configured_item_is_removed_and_the_rest_kept() {` › `let region = production_code(`

A `mod tests { … }` block, brace-matched rather than indentation-matched.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_configured_item_is_removed_and_the_rest_kept() {` › `let region = production_code("use a::b;\n#[cfg(test)]\nuse c::d;\nfn below() {}\n");`

A `#[cfg(test)] use`, which truncates `production_region` and is the
shape `src/engine/coordinator.rs` carries on line 36 of 1599.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_configured_item_is_removed_and_the_rest_kept() {` › `let region = production_code("#[cfg(test)]\nuse a::{b, c};\nfn below() {}\n");`

A braced `use`, whose item ends at `}` and takes the `;` with it.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_configured_item_is_removed_and_the_rest_kept() {` › `let region = production_code(`

A test-only `const` whose value is a string, and a test-only `fn`.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_configured_item_is_removed_and_the_rest_kept() {` › `let region = production_code(`

A struct field, which ends at its comma rather than at the struct's brace
(`src/engine/options.rs` has three).

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_configured_item_is_removed_and_the_rest_kept() {` › `let region =`

Attributes stacked on one item belong to that item.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn a_configured_attribute_in_prose_is_inert() {`

A `#[cfg(test)]` that is prose neither cuts nor is removed.

The two attacks the `//`-only strip this replaced could not see, both
measured against the barrier census: with either one planted as line 1 of a
production file, a second `TopologyFold::parse_log` route in the same file
became invisible and the census passed.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn a_configured_attribute_in_prose_is_inert() {` › `let region = production_code(`

And a real attribute beside prose that quotes one is still found.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_region_contains_the_truncated_one() {`

The region is a superset of [`production_region`]'s, file by file, over the
tree — and keeps what the truncating region cannot: the code below the cut.

### What each assertion here is worth, because they are not worth the same

The prefix comparison is a **consistency check on a construction, and it
cannot fail.** [`production_code`] never writes below the index of its first
`#[cfg(test)]` match, [`production_region`] cuts at exactly that index, and
no token straddles a cut that lands on visible code — so the two sides are
the same bytes of the same blanking, and no input separates them. It is kept
because it would start failing if either function's cut point moved, which is
a real regression; it is not the non-weakening proof, and this doc used to
claim it was.

What carries the claim is the rest: `strictly_larger >= 8` and the
`src/engine/coordinator.rs` membership check (a strict gain somewhere, by
name), and the sentinel block below, which is the one property the truncating
region does not have and the one a desync destroys — an item appended *below*
everything the file declares is still in the region. That block fails if
`configured_item_end` ever blanks to end of file again, on any file in the
tree, which is how `PR7-R2C-CHAR-LITERAL-DESYNC` hid a forged item with a
zero-byte region delta.

### The non-weakening measurement, corrected

The commit that introduced this helper claimed that over 15 census needles
and 92 source files the new region "drops 0 occurrences the old line-based
region kept". That is false as written, and the same commit deleted a census
row *because* of the occurrence it drops. Re-measured over the tree **as that
commit left it**, restricted to the 76 files the censuses actually scan
(whole-file test modules excluded, as every census excludes them): **8
(file, needle) pairs drop, 20 occurrences**, and every one of the 20 is prose
or a string literal rather than code —

| pair | occurrences | what they are |
|---|---|---|
| `src/agent/proc.rs` × `run_with_timeout` | 3 | doc comments; the census's expected count was re-derived to 5 |
| `src/effects.rs` × `Command::new(` | 1 | **a string literal**: `DENIAL_FIXTURES`' `source:` field, a fixture that exists to be refused |
| `src/effects.rs` × `run_with_timeout` | 1 | a doc comment in [`production_code`]'s own prose |
| five files × `TopologyFold` | 15 | doc comments; that needle decides *set membership* for `FOLD_MENTIONS` and all five files stay in the set |

So the claim that holds is "drops no occurrence that is **code**". The
string-literal drop is the in-domain one: `Command::new(` is a needle of
`runner::contract::tests::every_production_process_start_is_classified`, `src/effects.rs`
is in that census's domain, and its row there was deleted by the same commit
— which is the counterexample to the sentence twenty lines above it.

The measurement is pinned to that commit's tree deliberately, because it is
not stable under editing: a doc comment written *here* naming
`RunnerRequest {` adds a ninth pair to it, since the old region counted
prose. Under the region this test is about it adds nothing at all, which is
the whole of why the blanking moved into the region.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_region_contains_the_truncated_one() {` › `assert!(`

And it is a *strict* superset somewhere, or the two regions are the same
function and the comparison above proves nothing. Eleven files gain today,
and they are the ones holding code below their first `#[cfg(test)]`: the
eight `every_production_region_that_stops_early_stops_at_a_module` pins
that still have code under the cut, plus the three test files carrying a
`#[cfg(test)] mod this_file_is_test_only {}` marker whose whole purpose
was to zero the truncating region.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn the_whole_region_contains_the_truncated_one() {` › `const SENTINEL: &str = "\npub fn sentinel_below_every_configured_item() {}\n";`

The assertion that can fail, and the property the truncating region does
not have: an item appended below everything a file declares is still in
the region. A `configured_item_end` that gives up and blanks to end of
file takes it — silently, and for the whole file — which is how a
desynced tokeniser hides a forged item behind a zero-byte delta.

## `pub(super) mod oracles` › `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn every_early_stop_is_at_a_module() {`

The **domain-deciding** function was written three times, the three
disagreed, and two of them are gone.

`PR5-R1-CFG-TEST-SHRINKS-THE-DOMAIN`, `PR6B-PRODUCTION-REGION-CUT-AT-A-CFG-\
TEST-USE`, and the class `PR5D-VISIBILITY-CHECK-DUPLICATED` names: a value
two places both maintain by hand disagree eventually, and the one that
disagrees silently is the one that decides what a census is allowed to see.
Measured across the tree by PR6 lane E, this crate had **three**
`production_region` implementations with three different semantics, and each
carried a hazard the other two did not:

| where | what it removed | the hazard it carried |
|---|---|---|
| [`production_region`] (`src/effects.rs`, `pub`) | everything from the **first** `#[cfg(test)]`, whatever it attaches to | a `#[cfg(test)] use` truncates the file |
| `runner::tests::production_region` (private, **removed**) | only `#[cfg(test)] mod … { … }` **blocks** | it did not blank comments, so its counts included prose |
| `events::log::tests::production_region` (private, still here) | from the first `#[cfg(test)]` in the **raw** source | `PR4-CENSUS-COMMENT-ORACLE`: a `#[cfg(test)]` in a comment truncates |

They were measured against each other rather than assumed: a `run_with_\
timeout` planted at the **last line** of `src/agent/claude.rs` — a file the
`effects.rs` region truncates to its first 66 of 1064 lines — is **seen** by
`runner::contract::tests::every_production_process_start_is_classified`, because that
census used the second implementation. Two censuses in one crate, both
answering "every production X is classified", over two different domains.

PR7's census repair removed the second and left **two**, which is what the
count at the bottom now pins. Every whole-tree census that asks a
*prohibition* question — the barrier census, the four censuses in
`runner::tests`, the container token census — now shares
[`crate::effects::production_code`]: the whole file, comments and string
literals blanked, every `#[cfg(test)]` **item** removed rather than the file
truncated at the first one. It is a fourth semantics and deliberately not a
fourth `production_region`. The claim that truncation is right for a *domain*
question did not survive `PR7-WRAPPERS-EMPTY-DOMAIN`: a cut at a
`#[cfg(test)] use` among the imports empties the domain, so
`externally_reachable_fns` reads this region too, and `production_region`
remains for the censuses that pin its cut point by name.
`events::log::tests::production_region` survives because two censuses in that
file ask about one named file each and assert their own strip removed
something before counting.

### What this test pins

The files the `effects.rs` implementation truncates at something that is
**not a module**. Each one loses everything below the cut from every census
that consults it, silently:

| file | region | cuts at |
|---|---|---|
| `src/engine/options.rs` | 4 / 166 | `#[cfg(test)] use` |
| `src/engine/coordinator.rs` | 35 / 1598 | `#[cfg(test)] use` |
| `src/engine/attempt.rs` | 25 / 721 | `#[cfg(test)] use` |
| `src/engine/resume.rs` | 30 / 792 | `#[cfg(test)] pub(super) fn` |
| `src/agent/claude.rs` | 66 / 1064 | `#[cfg(test)] pub const` |
| `src/agent/codex.rs` | 163 / 2009 | `#[cfg(test)] pub const` |
| `src/agent/copilot.rs` | 107 / 871 | `#[cfg(test)] pub const` |
| `src/agent/proc.rs` | 970 / 7946 | `#[cfg(test)] pub(super) fn` |
| `src/agent/bin.rs` | 224 / 533 | `#[cfg(test)] impl` |
| `src/util.rs` | 680 / 897 | `#[cfg(test)] pub(crate) fn` |

`resume.rs`'s shape is a test-only **function**, not the `use` lane B named,
so a repair written against that name alone would leave it.

**This does not repair them.** Moving `#[cfg(test)]` items in three
schema-1..3 engine files and four PR4 adapter files is a change to earlier
slices' code with reach far beyond this claim, and PR6's
`invariants_preserved[1]` is "legacy engine execution unchanged". What it
does is make the shrink **counted**: an eleventh file joining this set fails
by name rather than quietly removing itself from every census that uses the
`effects.rs` region.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn every_early_stop_is_at_a_module() {` › `fn cut_shape(source: &str) -> Option<String> {`

What the first `#[cfg(test)]` in `source` attaches to, or `None` when the
file has none. Read out of the **blanked** text, exactly as
[`production_region`] reads it, so a `#[cfg(test)]` quoted in a doc
comment neither cuts nor is classified — `src/runner/container.rs`
carries such a comment, its own warning about this hazard.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn every_early_stop_is_at_a_module() {` › `fn is_module(shape: &str) -> bool {`

Whether the cut is at a module — `mod tests {`, `mod fake;`,
`pub(crate) mod fixtures`, `mod this_file_is_test_only {}`. A test module
is what the region is *for*, so cutting at one loses nothing.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn every_early_stop_is_at_a_module() {` › `assert!(is_module("mod tests {"));`

CONTROLS, both directions. A classifier that answered one thing always
would produce this same set by luck on a tree with ten offenders.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn every_early_stop_is_at_a_module() {` › `assert!(`

And the domain really was walked: far more files cut at a module than not,
so an empty or near-empty scan cannot produce the expected set.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn every_early_stop_is_at_a_module() {` › `let definitions: usize = scanned_sources()`

Both surviving implementations are still there, and no third has been
added. If one is deleted, unified or duplicated, this table is stale and
the doc comment above is a lie — which is the failure
`PR5D-CI-COMPONENT-CENSUS-COMMENT-ORACLE` is about, one level out.
Counted in code, not asserted from prose.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn every_early_stop_is_at_a_module() {` › `let shared: usize = scanned_sources()`

And the shared prohibition region has exactly one definition, which is
the whole point of having removed the third `production_region`.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn typed_test_functions_are_removed_and_later_code_is_kept() {`

Typed test wrappers must disappear without hiding later production.
A return-type comma is not a field separator; a function-pointer field's
comma still is. Incomplete items retain their bodies for the census.

## `pub(in crate::effects::tests) fn a_configured_attribute_in_prose_is_inert() {`

A `#[cfg(test)]` that is prose neither cuts nor is removed.

The two attacks the `//`-only strip this replaced could not see, both
measured against the barrier census: with either one planted as line 1 of a
production file, a second `TopologyFold::parse_log` route in the same file
became invisible and the census passed.
