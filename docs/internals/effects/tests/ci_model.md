# `src/effects/tests/ci_model.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/effects/tests/ci_model.rs`](../../../../src/effects/tests/ci_model.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does. These notes started as the module's source prose.
Each code fragment in a heading is an exact source substring. When a heading names an enclosing
item before `›`, find that item first, then the following fragment within it.

## Module

What CI runs, on which runners, and with which shells — as constants.

**One authority, deliberately.** The workflow oracle in `super::workflow`
checks that `.github/workflows/ci.yml` matches these; the cfg census in
`super::cfg` decides which of [`CI_TARGETS`]'s runners compiles a predicate.
A runner list written down twice is a list where one copy gets updated, and
the copy that does not is the one that quietly stops measuring — with
nothing failing to say so. Both readers take the same table.

The three effect denials are **restored** here rather than inherited.
`super`'s module-level allowance exists because that file drives
`clippy-driver` over fixtures it has to create; this module names constants
and performs no effect at all, so the allowance has no business reaching it.

## `pub(super) const CI_WORKFLOW: &str = ".github/workflows/ci.yml";`

The workflow every claim in this section is about.

## `pub(super) const CLIPPY_GATE: &str = "cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings";`

The command a platform's Clippy leg must run, character for character.

Character for character is the point. `- run: echo cargo clippy ...` is
`BRIDGE-CI-SHAPE-TEST-IS-A-SUBSTRING-ORACLE`'s first escape: it satisfies any
`contains` check while the job merely echoes, succeeds, and lets the
aggregate settle green over a platform Clippy never examined.

## `pub(super) const TEST_COMMAND: &str = "cargo test --all-targets --all-features";`

The command that executes this file's fixtures, character for character.

## `pub(super) const WINDOWS_BUILD_WITNESS: &str = "cargo build --all-targets --all-features";`

The hosted codegen and link witness for the platform whose tests run
self-hosted, character for character.

`cargo check` and Clippy type-check and stop before codegen, and the
self-hosted leg links with the golden image's toolchain, which moves only
by re-curation. Without this step nothing on GitHub's current stable ever
code-generates or links the Windows tree: a Windows-only codegen or link
failure on current stable would pass every hosted leg while the guest, one
stable behind, links and passes. `cargo build --all-targets` rather than
`cargo test --no-run`: the latter builds only test-profile artifacts, so a
`#[cfg(all(windows, not(test)))]` body in a binary is never linked by it,
where `--all-targets` links the library and the binaries **and** their
unit-test harnesses, plus examples and integration tests. It executes
nothing, so the suite's execution stays where the decision record put it.

In the dev profile. `cargo test` builds the test profile, which inherits
from dev and is identical to it until the manifest says otherwise, and that
compile happens on the guest with the image's toolchain; so what stays
hosted on current stable is the dev-profile compile and link of every
target, and what moves with execution is the test-profile compile. A
`[profile.test]` override that splits the two is a manifest edit in the
diff. A link failure that needs `--release` is not covered here and is not
covered on `master` either; `release.yml` builds the shipped artifact with
`--release`, and that build failing is a red release, not a green CI over a
broken tree.

## `pub(super) const GIT_IDENTITY_SCRIPT: &str = "git config --global user.email \"ci@upstroke.local\"\ngit config --global user.name \"upstroke CI\"\n";`

The script the test jobs run before the suite, character for character:
an identity for the commits several tests make.

Pinned because a `run:` step is a shell with the checkout in front of it.
`git fetch origin master && git checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD` appended here
would test `master` while the labels, the fields, the shell, the input-free
checkout and the pinned test command that follows all still matched.
Measured, `MUT-TEST-WINDOWS-RUN-RETARGETED` and `MUT-TEST-RUN-RETARGETED`.

## `pub(super) const TEST_SCRIPTS: [&str; 2] = [GIT_IDENTITY_SCRIPT, TEST_COMMAND];`

Every script a test job may run: the identity script and the suite.

## `pub(super) const TEST_WINDOWS_SCRIPTS: [&str; 2] = [GIT_IDENTITY_SCRIPT, WINDOWS_TEST_WITNESS];`

The scripts the self-hosted leg runs: the identity script, and the suite
with the witness that it executed.

## `pub(super) const WINDOWS_TEST_FLOOR: u32 = 1700;`

The count the self-hosted leg's suite must report before the job is allowed
to succeed.

At `cb8ac1f` it reports 1771 there: 1761 from the lib harness, 10 from the
bin one, 0 from the example. The floor sits below that by a margin wide enough that
ordinary churn does not touch it and narrow enough that a suite which
silently stopped running cannot clear it. Dropping this many Windows tests
is a deliberate act, and it edits this number in the same change.

## `pub(super) const WINDOWS_TEST_WITNESS: &str`

The self-hosted leg's suite step, character for character: the pinned test
command, its exit status, and a count of what libtest reported.

Every other pin in this contract is an equality over `ci.yml`, and each
refuses one named way of arriving at a green job over a suite that never
ran. This one refuses the arrival itself. Cargo can be told to compile every
harness and execute none by a `target.<triple>.runner` in a repository
`.cargo/config.toml`, in `$CARGO_HOME`, in any directory above the checkout,
or in the process environment, and it can be told to build no harness of
this crate at all by a root `[workspace]` whose `default-members` name
another one. Three of those five are written where nothing reading this
repository can see them, the fifth has as many spellings as TOML has
whitespace, and the list closes only if Cargo stops growing. A count does
not enumerate them: a wrapper that executes nothing and prints nothing
leaves no `test result: ok.` line, whichever route installed it, and that
is every misconfiguration and every lazy substitution. It is not every
substitution. A wrapper written to print libtest's summary line clears the
floor, and so does a decoy crate whose `harness = false` main prints it;
both are a forgery, on the machine or in the diff, and the paragraph below
is where forgeries are bounded.

What it does not do is bound a hostile candidate, and no step in this file
does. An edit to `ci.yml` deletes this one as easily as the guards it
replaces, and the decision record says so where it says where the boundary
actually is. What it bounds is the guest: the machine that now executes this
platform's suite is provisioned outside the repository, so its Cargo home
and its environment are inputs no reviewer of a diff can check, and this is
the leg saying that it ran what it claims to have run.
Measured, `MUT-WINDOWS-WITNESS-FLOOR-DROPPED` and
`MUT-WINDOWS-WITNESS-COUNT-DROPPED`.

## `pub(super) const FMT_GATE: &str = "cargo fmt --check";`

The formatter gate and the six shell gates the `lint` job runs from the
repository root, character for character.

## `pub(super) const GATE_SCRIPTS: [&str; 8] = [`

Every script a gate job may run. A union across the three gate jobs rather
than a set per job: `lint (macos)` running the formatter would be
redundant, not an escape, and the one command that must sit on exactly one
job, the Windows build witness, is pinned to its carrier separately.

## `pub(super) const PINNED_ACTIONS: [&str; 3] = [`

The actions a step may `uses:`, each pinned to the commit it was reviewed
at. An action off this list is code nobody here reviewed running with a
checkout of its own; a floating tag (`@v4`) is that action at whatever
commit the tag points to tomorrow. Measured, `MUT-STEP-USES-UNPINNED`.

## `pub(super) const ACTION_INPUTS: [(&str, &[&str]); 3] = [`

The inputs each pinned action may be given, by action prefix.

Pinning the commit says which code runs; this says what it is told to do,
and the difference is not academic. `Swatinem/rust-cache` accepts a
`cmd-format` input and wraps the commands it runs in it, so a cache step
with one input can run `git checkout` against another tree before Clippy and
the build witness ever see the candidate -- with the action allowlisted, the
checkout input-free, and every `run:` still exact. An input this contract
does not model is refused for the same reason an unknown field is.
Measured, `MUT-CACHE-CMD-FORMAT`.

## `pub(super) const TOOLCHAIN_COMPONENTS: [&str; 2] = ["clippy", "rustfmt, clippy"];`

The `components` values the toolchain action may be given.

The values, not just the key. The action builds a shell command from this
input and interpolates it into a later Bash line, so a value carrying
`;git fetch origin master && git checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD;` installs
Clippy, checks out another tree, and exits zero — through an allowlisted
action at a pinned commit with an allowlisted input name. Measured,
`MUT-COMPONENTS-INJECTED`.

## `pub(super) const TEST_WINDOWS_JOB: &str = "test-windows";`

The job that runs those fixtures for the one platform whose test execution
left GitHub's runners, and the labels it must run on -- exactly.

The Windows suite is spawn- and worktree-heavy, and on `windows-latest` it
was the whole CI wall clock: a median of 12.5 minutes and a tail of 21 on
identical code, because the harness varied 535-1154 s with the host the
runner landed on. It runs instead on an ephemeral self-hosted guest -- a
throwaway overlay of a frozen image, one job per boot, registered with a
single-use just-in-time config -- in about two and a half minutes
(`decisions/2026-09-01-self-hosted-windows-test-leg.md`).

The labels are an equality because a looser `runs-on:` is a different
machine: `[self-hosted, windows]` admits any Windows runner the account ever
registers, and the third label is what names the curated image. The
platform's Clippy and MSRV legs stay on [`CI_TARGETS`]'s `windows-latest`,
which is why that entry is unchanged: GitHub's runner is still the witness
that compiles every `#[cfg(windows)]` body, and through
[`WINDOWS_BUILD_WITNESS`] the one that code-generates and links it on
current stable, shipped binaries and test harnesses alike.

## `pub(super) const SELF_HOSTED_TEST_PLATFORM: &str = "windows-latest";`

The [`CI_TARGETS`] runner whose tests run in [`TEST_WINDOWS_JOB`] rather than
in the `test` matrix. Its shell and cfg valuations carry over: the guest
carries PowerShell 7, so a `run:` step resolves to `pwsh` there exactly as
on `windows-latest`, and it builds the same MSVC tuple.

## `pub(super) const MSRV_JOB: &str = "msrv";`

The job that holds this crate to the floor it publishes, and the command it
must run -- character for character, for `--locked`'s sake.

`--locked` is the load-bearing flag and the reason this is a pin rather than
a prefix. Without it Cargo may resolve `Cargo.lock` forward, and this
manifest carries two exact-version pins placed for precisely that hazard:
`globset =0.4.19`, because 0.4.20 raised its MSRV to 1.88, and
`yaml-rust2 =0.12.0`, because 0.12.0 declares 1.85.0 -- this crate's floor
exactly, so its next minor is free to leave the contract. An unlocked MSRV
leg compiles a dependency set no release ships and reports green over a floor
it never tested. `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §2 and `CONTRIBUTING.md` both publish
the command with the flag.

## `pub(super) const RUSTFLAGS_KEY: &str = "RUSTFLAGS";`

The workflow-scope compiler flags, and the two names that decide what any
compilation in this workflow actually sees.

`CODING_STANDARDS.md` §11 makes this load-bearing rather than a convenience.
`unfulfilled_lint_expectations` is warn-by-default, so an `#[expect(...)]` on
a rustc lint "retires a suppression only where warnings are promoted to
errors. `ci.yml` sets `RUSTFLAGS: -D warnings` at workflow scope, so today
that is every leg -- which means narrowing it to a single job would silently
take the self-retirement guarantee with it." The word in that sentence this
contract answers is *silently*: nothing read the setting until now.

The pin is an equality because a `contains` reading is exactly what fails
here. `-D warnings -A clippy::disallowed_methods` contains `-D warnings` and
switches off the effect denylist this whole file exists to enforce.

`CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` is modelled because *effective* is the claim, not
*declared*. Cargo reads it in preference to `RUSTFLAGS` and ignores
`RUSTFLAGS` entirely when it is set, so binding it anywhere in this workflow
is the same defect as rewriting the value -- with the pinned line left in
place to read past.

## `pub(super) const AGGREGATE_JOB: &str = "merge-gate";`

The job that aggregates the gates, and the branch-protection context it
publishes. `MAINTAINING.md` points the external rule at this one name, so a
rename leaves branch protection guarding a context nothing produces.

## `pub(super) const AGGREGATE_SCRIPT: &str = r#"failed=0`

The aggregate's script, pinned.

A pin rather than a family of substring predicates, which is what the
standing row forbids growing more of. The enumerated escape is
`for gate in LINT LINT_WINDOWS MSRV TEST; do : LINT_MACOS` -- a loop that
omits a gate while a `contains` check for the omitted name still passes --
and a pin refuses it outright. The pin is not its own oracle: the loop's gate
list is re-derived from `needs:` below and compared, so this literal being a
faithful copy is itself checked against the job graph.

## `pub(super) const GATE_JOB_FIELDS: [&str; 4] = ["name", "runs-on", "steps", "timeout-minutes"];`

The fields a platform Clippy job may declare -- an equality, not a denylist.

`if:` and `continue-on-error:` are absent by construction rather than by
enumeration, which is the difference between this and the whitespace-
normalised `if: false` search it replaces: that search could not refuse
`if: ${{ false }}`, an `env`-driven expression, or any disabling form nobody
had thought of. An unknown field is refused, so the next one costs a review
rather than a finding.

## `pub(super) const STEP_FIELDS: [&str; 5] = ["name", "run", "shell", "uses", "with"];`

The fields a step of a *gate* job may declare. Same reasoning, and `env:` is
absent for a reason of its own: a step-level environment is enough to
retarget the compile the gate performs -- `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` on the macOS
leg lints a target no `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` body belongs to, while
the `run:` scalar still matches character for character. Measured,
`MUT-GATE-STEP-RETARGETED`. The steps that carry an `env:` outside the
aggregate are the two that run the suite, the hosted test step and the
Windows step, and their maps are pinned whole by [`TEST_STEP_ENV`] and
[`TEST_WINDOWS_STEP_ENV`] rather than admitted by field name.

## `pub(super) const TEMP_FOLDS_CASE_KEY: &str = "UPSTROKE_TEST_TEMP_FOLDS_CASE";`

The one declaration a test step makes to the suite it runs: that the
temporary directory the suite runs under folds case.
`the_temporary_object_scan_resolves_case_aliases_as_the_filesystem_does`
*requires* its native casefold branch -- Git's lower-case fan-out path
resolving to a stored upper-case directory -- only where this variable is
exactly `1`, and observes the branch everywhere else, so a case-sensitive
volume anywhere the variable is not set takes the negative branch instead of
failing (`PR258-CASEFOLD-EXPECTATION-KEYED-ON-TARGET-OS`: keyed on the target
OS, the requirement failed on a supported case-sensitive volume before the
scan was checked). The declaration is per leg because the filesystems are:
the macOS runner's temporary directory folds case, the ubuntu runner's does
not, and the guest's NTFS does.

## `pub(super) const TEST_STEP_ENV: [(&str, &str); 1] = [(`

The whole `env:` map of the hosted step that runs the suite, as an equality.
The value is an expression over the matrix -- `1` on `macos-latest`, empty on
`ubuntu-latest` -- so one step declares for both legs. Pinned whole, the way
[`WORKFLOW_ENV`] and the aggregate's map are: a dropped binding makes the leg
observe the casefold branch instead of requiring it, so a temporary directory
that stopped folding case would pass unreported (undeclared on ext4 the alias
test passes, declared it fails at the declaration,
`34-r6-casefold-declaration.log`); a value other than `1` on
a folding leg does the same, and any other key is the step-level environment
[`STEP_FIELDS`] refuses everywhere else, since one key is enough to retarget
the compile. Measured, `MUT-TEST-CASEFOLD-DECLARATION-DROPPED`,
`MUT-TEST-CASEFOLD-DECLARED-ON-THE-WRONG-LEG` and
`MUT-TEST-STEP-RETARGETED-THROUGH-THE-ADMITTED-ENV`.

## `pub(super) const TEST_WINDOWS_STEP_ENV: [(&str, &str); 1] = [(TEMP_FOLDS_CASE_KEY, "1")];`

The same declaration on the self-hosted step, `1` outright: one runner, no
matrix. Measured, `MUT-TEST-WINDOWS-CASEFOLD-DECLARATION-DROPPED`.

## `pub(super) const TEST_STEP_FIELDS: [&str; 6] = ["env", "name", "run", "shell", "uses", "with"];`

The fields the step that runs the suite may declare: [`STEP_FIELDS`] plus the
`env` whose map [`TEST_STEP_ENV`] and [`TEST_WINDOWS_STEP_ENV`] pin. Every
other step of both test jobs keeps [`STEP_FIELDS`].

## `pub(super) const AGGREGATE_STEP_FIELDS: [&str; 4] = ["env", "name", "run", "shell"];`

The fields the aggregate's one step may declare: `name`, `run` and `shell`,
plus the `env` whose mapping is pinned key by key -- as the two suite-running
steps' maps are pinned by [`TEST_STEP_ENV`] and [`TEST_WINDOWS_STEP_ENV`].

## `pub(super) const AGGREGATE_JOB_FIELDS: [&str; 6] =`

The fields the aggregate declares. `if:` is *required* here and pinned to
`always()` below: without it a failed dependency skips the aggregate, which
leaves the required context missing rather than red.

## `pub(super) const TEST_JOB_FIELDS: [&str; 5] =`

The fields the job that runs these fixtures declares.

## `pub(super) const TEST_WINDOWS_JOB_FIELDS: [&str; 4] =`

The fields the self-hosted test job declares: the `test` job's set without a
`strategy:`, since one runner needs no matrix. `if:` and `continue-on-error:`
are absent by construction, as everywhere in this contract.

## `pub(super) const MSRV_JOB_FIELDS: [&str; 5] =`

The fields the MSRV leg declares. The same shape as the `test` job, and named
separately because the reason one of its absences matters is its own.

`continue-on-error:` is the field this refuses that nothing else would have.
A *disabled* leg (`if: false`) still reports `skipped` to the aggregate,
whose loop demands `success` and fails; an *absolved* leg reports `success`
after its check failed, so the aggregate reads success, `upstroke-ci` settles
green, and the floor `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §2 publishes went unverified on
all three platforms at once.

## `pub(super) const OPTIONAL_DEFAULTS_FIELD: [&str; 1] = ["defaults"];`

The one field a job -- or the workflow itself -- may declare in addition to
its required set.

`defaults:` is optional rather than forbidden because forbidding it would
make the effective-shell resolution below unreachable, and an unreachable
resolution is an untested one. It is modelled instead: declared, its shape is
checked and the shell it resolves to is compared against what this contract
expects for that runner.

## `pub(super) const WORKFLOW_FIELDS: [&str; 6] =`

The workflow's own top-level fields: required, then the same optional one.

## `pub(super) const DEFAULTS_FIELDS: [&str; 1] = ["run"];`

The fields a `defaults:` mapping and its `run:` mapping may declare.

`working-directory:` is **not** among them. GitHub applies a job- or
workflow-level default directory to every `run:` step, so
`working-directory: ci-pass` beside a trivial `ci-pass/Cargo.toml` makes the
pinned test command test that empty crate -- with the labels, the shells,
the checkout and the command all still matching character for character.
No job here needs one, so the field is refused rather than modelled.
Measured, `MUT-DEFAULTS-WORKING-DIRECTORY`.

## `pub(super) const WORKFLOW_ENV: [(&str, &str); 2] = [`

The workflow's `env:` mapping, pinned whole.

An equality rather than a guard per name. [`RUSTFLAGS_KEY`] and
[`ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS_KEY`] were guarded by name because they decide what the
compiler sees; but a *name this contract never thought of* decides whether
the compiled thing runs at all. `CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_PC_WINDOWS_MSVC_RUNNER`
pointed at a script that exits zero makes `cargo test` build every harness
and execute none, on the Windows target only, which no Unix leg would
notice. Cargo documents that setting as applying to `cargo test`. Pinning
the whole map refuses every such name at once, including the ones nobody
here has thought of yet. Measured, `MUT-WORKFLOW-ENV-TARGET-RUNNER`.

## `pub(super) const WORKFLOW_PERMISSIONS: [(&str, &str); 1] = [("contents", "read")];`

The workflow's `permissions:` mapping, pinned whole.

The trust story rests on this one binding: the job token is read-only, so a
candidate's build scripts and tests cannot push. `permissions: write-all`,
or a `contents: write` here, hands every step of every job a token that can,
and `actions/checkout` leaves that credential configured for the Git
commands a test makes afterwards. Destroying the guest afterwards does not
recall a push. Requiring the key to *exist* is not the check; the value is.
Measured, `MUT-WORKFLOW-PERMISSIONS-WIDENED`.

## `pub(super) const OVERRIDING_REPO_FILES: [&str; 4] = [`

Repository files that outrank what `ci.yml` says, and must therefore not
exist while this contract reads only `ci.yml`.

A `rust-toolchain.toml` overrides the rustup default the pinned toolchain
action sets, so every bare `cargo` command in every job would run a compiler
the workflow never names -- including the witness that exists to compile
current stable. A `.cargo/config.toml` can bind
`target.<triple>.runner`, which Cargo applies to `cargo test`: every Windows
harness would build and a wrapper would report success without executing
one. Both are invisible to a reader of `ci.yml`. `CLAUDE.md` already states
the project has no toolchain file and selects toolchains at call sites; this
is that convention made enforceable. Adding either file is a deliberate act
that must extend this contract in the same change.

A Rust test holds this, and a Rust test is exactly what a `.cargo/config.toml`
runner switches off. That is a real limit and it is why this is not written
as a defence: it catches the file committed by accident, on a developer's
machine and in CI, and it says in the diff that the convention is deliberate.
The leg whose execution left GitHub's runners is covered instead by
[`WINDOWS_TEST_WITNESS`], which counts what actually ran.

## `pub(super) const TOOLCHAIN_ACTION: &str = "dtolnay/rust-toolchain@";`

The toolchain every leg but the MSRV floor installs, and the action that
installs it.

The action is pinned by commit in [`PINNED_ACTIONS`]; this pins its
**input**, which is the part that decides which compiler runs. A
`lint (windows)` downgraded from `stable` to the guest's own `1.97.1` makes
the hosted witness link the same toolchain the self-hosted leg already
links, so nothing in CI code-generates the Windows tree on current stable
and a build script emitting a bad link directive only on newer rustc goes
green. The MSRV leg pins its own floor separately, from the manifest.
Measured, `MUT-GATE-TOOLCHAIN-DOWNGRADED`.

## `pub(super) const KNOWN_SHELLS: [&str; 6] = ["bash", "cmd", "powershell", "pwsh", "python", "sh"];`

The shell keywords GitHub resolves to an interpreter it defines.

Anything else is a **custom shell**: GitHub builds the command line
`<template> {0}` where `{0}` is the file it wrote the script to. So
`shell: true` runs `true /path/to/script` -- the step succeeds and the script
never executes. On a Clippy gate that is a green job that never linted, and
on the aggregate it is a required check that never read a single result.
Measured, `MUT-GATE-STEP-CUSTOM-SHELL`.

## `pub(super) const AGGREGATE_SHELL: &str = "bash";`

The shell the aggregate's script needs. It is written in bash -- `[[ ]]` and
`${!name}` are bash, not POSIX sh and not PowerShell.

## `pub(super) struct CiTarget {`

A runner CI uses, the target it compiles, and the shell its `run:` steps get.

The tuple is the load-bearing half. What discharges a platform's clause is
not a job *name* but the target whose `#[cfg(...)]` bodies that job compiles,
and [`cfg_regions`] evaluates predicates against the valuations these
invocations actually set rather than collecting the names inside them.

## `pub(super) struct CiTarget` › `pub(super) runner: &'static str,`

The `runs-on:` value.

## `pub(super) struct CiTarget` › `pub(super) triple: &'static str,`

The target tuple that runner's stable toolchain builds by default.

## `pub(super) struct CiTarget` › `pub(super) default_shell: &'static str,`

The shell a `run:` step resolves to on this runner when neither the step,
the job nor the workflow declares one. GitHub's documented default is
`bash` on Linux and macOS and `pwsh` on Windows, and it is pinned rather
than assumed because a resolved shell that is not what this contract
expects is a step that may not run the command at all.

## `pub(super) struct CiTarget` › `pub(super) keys: &'static [(&'static str, &'static str)],`

The `key = "value"` cfg pairs this runner's compilations set. **Every**
key this census models is listed: a key absent from this table is not
set by the invocation, which makes `key = "value"` false rather than
unknown.

## `pub(super) struct CiTarget` › `pub(super) flags: &'static [&'static str],`

The bare cfg flags set by every compilation this runner performs.

## `pub(super) struct CiTarget` › `pub(super) per_invocation_flags: &'static [&'static [&'static str]],`

The flags set by *some* compilation and not others.

`cargo clippy --all-targets` and `cargo test --all-targets` compile the
library twice: once as a library, and once as a test harness with `test`
set. Coverage asks whether **some** invocation compiles the body, so the
valuations are enumerated rather than merged -- merging them would make
`all(test, not(test))` look reachable.
