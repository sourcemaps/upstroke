# `src/interaction.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/interaction.rs`](../../src/interaction.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does; this file is the whole of its prose, moved out of
the source verbatim. Each section is headed by the line of code the comment sat above, spelled
as it is in the source, so the heading is the grep string that finds the code.

## Module

Interaction model (DESIGN.md §12): questions are events, delivery is
pluggable, and answers arrive through a seam rather than a hard-coded
prompt.

Two traits keep §8's split honest. A [`Notifier`] only *delivers* — it can
fail, be missing, or be a phone, and the run survives either way. An
[`AnswerSource`] is where an answer comes *back* from; v0.1 ships the
attached terminal, and step 8 replaces it with an event-log reader backing
`upstroke answer <id>` without anything else moving.

Every question is also written to `questions/<id>.json` (§15) the moment it
is raised. That file — not the terminal output — is the contract a
notifier, a dashboard, or a future UI reads: the engine stays headless and
panes are thin clients over its record.

## `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, clippy::disallowed_macros)]`

Allowlist placement: the **funnel section** of `effects/allowlist.toml`, which
carries this module's review clause -- effects only inside site-taking APIs,
no writable handle returned. `decisions.effect_site_inventory.mechanism` (2).

## `pub enum InteractionMode {`

`[interaction] mode` (§17).

## `pub enum InteractionMode` › `Never,`

CI: nothing may block on a human. Questions degrade to parked-task
reporting and the exit status says so (§12).

## `pub enum InteractionMode` › `OnBlock,`

Ask only once the runnable frontier is empty — the precise definition
of a hard block (§12).

## `impl InteractionMode` › `pub fn interactive(self) -> bool {`

Whether a human may be asked at all.

## `pub struct QuestionRecord {`

A question plus whatever came back. Serialized to `questions/<id>.json` at
raise time and rewritten when answered, so a reader that arrives late still
sees the whole exchange.

## `pub struct QuestionRecord` › `pub answer: Option<Answer>,`

`None` while open.

## `pub struct AnswerRecord {`

What `answers/<question-id>.json` holds: the `Answer` (flattened, so the
file is the answer's own object) and the attribution a human ruled on the
question, in the two optional fields the `design_defect` record carries in
the same serde mold (`reviews/2026-09-14-o3-attribution-record.md`, R5).
A record without a ruling serialises to exactly the bytes `write_answer`
wrote before the fields existed, and a file written before them reads as
`Unclassified`. The attribution sits on the record rather than inside the
`Answered` variant because a decline is ruled on too: the `design_defect`
record is written for declined answers, and the rule attributes every
question that reaches a person.

## `pub struct AnswerRecord` › `pub attribution: Option<QuestionAttribution>,`

`None` is no ruling — what `upstroke answer` writes today — and is not a
discovery: the writer that turns the file into a `design_defect` applies the
default, the file does not.

## `pub struct AnswerRecord` › `pub citation: Option<String>,`

A conviction's cited checklist item or precedent; `None` on discoveries, and
invalid to write beside `design_defect` — see `write_answer`.

## `impl AnswerRecord` › `pub fn unattributed(answer: Answer) -> Self {`

No ruling. The shape `upstroke answer` produces.

## `impl AnswerRecord` › `pub fn discovered(answer: Answer) -> Self {`

Ruled a hole design could not reasonably have foreseen: the default polarity
of the 2026-09-01 decision, stated rather than left to the reader.

## `impl AnswerRecord` › `pub fn convicted(answer: Answer, citation: String) -> Result<Self, UncitedConviction> {`

Ruled a design-phase defect, citing the checklist item or precedent that was
available and unapplied. A blank citation is refused through the `Result`:
no citation, no conviction. The rule is `events::cited`, shared with
`DesignDefect::convicted`.

## `impl AnswerRecord` › `pub fn effective_attribution(&self) -> EffectiveAttribution<'_> {`

What a reader treats the record as, derived by `EffectiveAttribution::derive`
and never re-decided: a `design_defect` whose citation is absent or blank
reads as a discovery.

## `pub fn write_question(dir: &Path, record: &QuestionRecord) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {`

§15: `questions/<question-id>.json`, the payload notifiers and UIs read.

Through `RunDir.WriteQuestionPayload`. Behaviour-neutral: the same bytes at
the same path, now named by the site the frozen inventory gives them.

## `pub fn answer_path(dir: &Path, id: &QuestionId) -> PathBuf {`

Where `upstroke answer` leaves an answer for a running or future engine.

Answers arrive as *files*, not as lines appended to `events.jsonl`. Keeping
the log single-writer is what makes it safe to reason about at all: two
processes appending concurrently is a portability question (and on Windows
a sharing question) that a directory of one-file-per-answer simply does not
raise. The engine ingests the file and emits the `question_answered` event
itself, so the log still records every answer — the file is transport, the
event is the record.

## `pub fn write_answer(`

The source retains the publication protocol required by §10.

The single writer of the answer file, and where the writer-side rule of the
2026-09-01 decision is enforced: an `AnswerRecord` carrying
`attribution: Some(DesignDefect)` with no citation, or a blank one, is
refused with `UpstrokeError::Refused` before anything is staged, so the
directory is left exactly as it was — no `.partial`, no file. Every other
shape is written as it is; the reader's rule (a citation-less conviction
reads as a discovery) covers a file something other than this writer
produced.

Write an answer atomically.

Temp file plus rename, because the engine may be reading this directory at
any moment. That atomicity is what lets [`read_answer`] be strict: it
refuses a file it cannot parse rather than skipping it, which is only a
safe policy because a half-written file can never be observed. A corrupt
one therefore means something outside upstroke wrote here, and silently
ignoring what might be an operator's answer is worse than stopping to say
so.
Through `Answer.StageWrite` then `Answer.PublishRename` — the two sites the
frozen inventory gives the answer command. Same two steps, same bytes.

## `pub fn read_answer_record(`

Read the whole record if one has been left — the answer and the ruling.
`None` simply means not yet. This is what a writer of the attributed
`design_defect` record reads, and the one reader that validates the two
attribution columns: a file whose `attribution` or `citation` is malformed
is `UpstrokeError::Parse` here, where `read_answer` tolerates it.

`Answer.Ingest` — a read-only observation, which is why it performs no
effect and is still a site: the inventory names it and a site nothing calls
cannot be shown to execute.

## `pub fn read_answer(dir: &Path, id: &QuestionId) -> Result<Option<Answer>, UpstrokeError> {`

The `Answer`, deserialised as `ir::Answer` exactly as the base did, so a
column the answer does not know — a foreign or malformed `attribution` or
`citation` included — is ignored as it always was; nothing of a ruling is
read here. The schema-3 engine's `EventLogAnswers` and
`coordinator::ingest_answer` read through this, so whatever a file carries,
a schema-3 `question_answered` event embeds the same `Answer` it always did,
the legacy `design_defect` record stays unclassified, and a resume that used
to park still parks: the ruling reaches no schema-3 record, which is the
contract's "its records read as unclassified" (R5). Round 1 of PR #290
returned this reader to the base's behaviour: reading through
`AnswerRecord` had made it refuse `{"answer":"unanswered","citation":7}`,
which the base accepted, and `Run::sweep_answers` propagated the refusal
before task selection.

## `fn read_answer_as<T: serde::de::DeserializeOwned>(`

The one read of the file, typed by its caller: `read_answer_record` asks for
the record, `read_answer` for the answer alone.

## `pub fn render_question(question: &Question) -> String {`

The human-facing form of a question. `context` is passed through verbatim:
whoever built the question owns quoting and labelling any agent-authored
text inside it, exactly as `review.rs` does with a diff.

## `pub trait Notifier {`

§8 `Notifier` — delivery only. Answers never come back through this trait,
which is what lets a run outlive its notifier.

## `pub struct CliNotifier;`

Announces a question on stderr as soon as it is raised (§12: eagerly, at
detection). One line — the full text belongs in the prompt at the hard
block and in the question file, not repeated in the middle of a run.

## `pub fn notifiers_for(ids: &[String], warnings: &mut Vec<String>) -> Vec<&'static dyn Notifier> {`

Resolve `[interaction] notify = [...]` to delivery channels. An id that
resolves to nothing warns rather than silently dropping notifications —
believing you configured an alert you never get is worse than having none.

## `pub trait AnswerSource {`

Where an answer comes from. Step 8 adds an event-log implementation behind
`upstroke answer <id>`; the engine does not change when it does.

## `pub trait AnswerSource` › `fn resolve(&self, question: &Question) -> Result<Answer, UpstrokeError>;`

Called only at a hard block (§12), never mid-frontier.

## `pub trait AnswerSource` › `fn poll(&self, _question: &Question) -> Result<Answer, UpstrokeError> {`

The non-blocking half: what is already there, without waiting or
prompting. The schema-4 loop asks it before every step, so an answer left
while the engine was away is ingested ahead of any other branch. The
default answers `Unanswered`, which is right for a terminal (a prompt is a
block, not a poll) and for CI; `EventLogAnswers` reads its file.

## `pub struct UnattendedAnswers;`

CI and every other detached context: nobody is there. Note this returns
`Unanswered`, not `Declined` — the task parks rather than failing, and the
run's exit status reports it (§12).

## `pub struct TerminalAnswers;`

§12's attached-terminal channel. Degrades to `Unanswered` whenever stdin is
not a terminal, so a run piped from a file or a service manager parks
instead of hanging on a read that will never return.

## `fn resolve(&self, question: &Question) -> Result<Answer, UpstrokeError> {` › `Ok(0) => Ok(Answer::Unanswered),`

EOF: the terminal went away mid-run. Park, do not fail.

## `pub struct EventLogAnswers<'a> {`

§19's hard block, for a run nobody is sitting in front of.

A detached but interactive run — `nohup`, a service unit, `upstroke run &` —
has no terminal to prompt at, but it is not CI either: a human is expected,
just not right now. So it waits for `upstroke answer` to leave a file, which
is what "hard block (interactive)" means when the block cannot be a prompt.

The budget is shared across every question this run asks rather than per
question, because it exists to bound how long a forgotten run holds a
workspace and a branch hostage — a per-question budget would multiply by the
number of questions and defeat that.

## `pub struct EventLogAnswers<'a>` › `remaining: Mutex<Duration>,`

Wait left across all questions. `Mutex` only because `resolve` takes
`&self`; the engine is single-threaded.

## `impl<'a> EventLogAnswers<'a>` › `pub const DEFAULT_POLL: Duration = Duration::from_secs(5);`

Poll often enough to feel responsive, rarely enough to be free.

## `impl<'a> EventLogAnswers<'a>` › `pub fn new(dir: PathBuf, budget: Duration, sleeper: &'a dyn Sleeper) -> Self {`

The waiting itself is injected, so a test can exercise a bounded wait
without spending it.

## `impl AnswerSource for EventLogAnswers<'_>` › `fn poll(&self, question: &Question) -> Result<Answer, UpstrokeError> {`

One read of the answer file and no wait: the file is either there or it
is not, and the budget is `resolve`'s to spend.

## `pub fn interpret(question: &Question, raw: &str) -> Answer {`

Interpret one typed line.

Empty deliberately means *parked*, not *declined*: a stray Enter must not
fail a task and block its dependents. Failing requires typing it.

## `pub(crate) fn answer_for_option(question: &Question, choice: usize) -> Option<Answer> {`

Resolve one rendered, 1-indexed option without losing the action encoded by
engine-authored terminal choices. `Question.options` predates typed option
records, so an option is a decline by what it says — one of
[`DECLINE_OPTIONS`] — and never by where it sits; treating a decline's label
as ordinary guidance would retry the task the operator explicitly chose to
give up on.

**It used to be positional.** Until PR #249's first repair round the last
option of every non-clarification list with two or more options was read as
the decline, which is where the legacy coordinator puts it. A schema-4
`HumanBinding` admission offers *agents* — `["claude-code", "copilot"]` —
and the conformance review picked `2` at the production parser: the second
agent became a durable `Declined`, and replay showed the root and its
repair `Failed` with the lineage lease released. An option list carries no
typed action, so the text the engine authors is the only thing that can say
which option declines.

## `pub(crate) const DECLINE_SPEND_OPTION: &str =`

The decline action of an `ApproveSpend` question, as the engine words it
for the operator.

## `pub(crate) const GIVE_UP_OPTION: &str =`

The give-up action of every other question that offers one, as the engine
words it for the operator, in both engines' lists.

## `pub(crate) const DECLINE_OPTIONS: [&str; 2] = [DECLINE_SPEND_OPTION, GIVE_UP_OPTION];`

Every option the engine authors as a decline. `coordinator::question_options`
and `coordinator::topology_question_options` build their lists from these
two constants, so the producer and [`is_decline_option`] cannot disagree
about which option declines; an option list from anywhere else — an
agent name, a legacy question file worded otherwise — declines nothing by
number, and `skip` typed at the prompt still does.

## `pub(crate) fn is_decline_option(option: &str) -> bool {`

Whether an option's text is one of the engine's decline actions.

## `pub fn answers_for<'a>(`

Pick the answer channel for a mode and the situation the run is actually in.

§12 lists two v0.1 channels, and which one applies is not a mode question
alone: `on_block` at an attached terminal means *prompt*, and the identical
config detached means *wait for `upstroke answer`*. Deciding it here rather
than in the engine keeps that distinction where the channels live.

A zero budget collapses the detached case back to parking immediately,
which is what an operator who does not want a run holding a workspace asks
for with `wait_on_block_secs = 0`.

## `pub trait Sleeper {`

Waiting, injectable so tests never actually sleep.

## `pub const DEFAULT_DEFER_BACKOFF: Duration = Duration::from_secs(60);`

First wait after a rate-limited attempt. Windows reset on the order of
hours (§13), but without the capacity engine there is no reset time to read
— so this backs off rather than pretending to know one.

## `pub const MAX_DEFER_BACKOFF: Duration = Duration::from_secs(600);`

Cap on the wait. Past this, waiting longer is worse than asking a human.

## `pub fn defer_backoff(base: Duration, round: u32) -> Duration {`

Doubling backoff, capped. `round` counts consecutive waits where deferred
tasks were the *only* runnable work.

## `fn picking_the_last_agent_offered_by_number_names_that_agent_and_declines_nothing() {`

PR #249's conformance review, finding 1, at the parser: a `HumanBinding`
question's options are agents, and `2` on `["claude-code", "copilot"]` is
`copilot`. Declining is `skip`, or an option that says so.

## `fn an_empty_line_parks_but_skip_declines()` › `assert_eq!(interpret(&question(), "\n"), Answer::Unanswered);`

A stray Enter must never fail a task and block its dependents.

## `fn a_number_picks_an_option_and_anything_else_is_free_text()` › `assert_eq!(`

Out of range is not silently clamped — it is the user's words.

## `fn the_answer_channel_follows_the_mode_and_the_situation()` › `assert_eq!(`

The test harness runs detached, so an interactive mode here resolves
to the waiting channel rather than a prompt nobody would see. That
is the §19 case a terminal-only implementation silently degraded to
CI behaviour.

## `fn the_answer_channel_follows_the_mode_and_the_situation()` › `let immediate = answers_for(InteractionMode::OnBlock, dir, Duration::ZERO, &idle);`

A zero budget is an explicit "do not hold the workspace": still not
a prompt, but it gives up immediately.

## `fn answers_survive_the_trip_through_a_file()` › `let leftovers: Vec<String> = std::fs::read_dir(&dir)`

Nothing partial is left behind for the engine to trip over.

## `fn a_detached_run_waits_for_an_answer_file_then_gives_up()` › `let dir = std::env::temp_dir().join(format!("upstroke-answer-wait-{}", std::process::id()));`

§19's "hard block (interactive)" for a run with no terminal: it
waits for `upstroke answer` rather than degrading to CI behaviour.

## `fn a_detached_run_waits_for_an_answer_file_then_gives_up()` › `let counting = CountingSleeper::default();`

Nothing ever arrives: the budget bounds the wait rather than the
run holding its workspace forever.

## `fn a_detached_run_waits_for_an_answer_file_then_gives_up()` › `assert_eq!(`

The budget is shared across questions, not granted per question, so
a run with many open questions cannot multiply its own deadline.

## `fn a_detached_run_waits_for_an_answer_file_then_gives_up()` › `let arriving = ArrivingSleeper {`

An answer that lands during the wait is picked up.

## `mod tests` › `struct ArrivingSleeper {`

Stands in for an operator running `upstroke answer` mid-wait.

## `fn unattended_parks_rather_than_declining()` › `let answer = UnattendedAnswers.resolve(&question()).expect("resolve");`

The distinction is the whole CI story: Declined fails the task,
Unanswered parks it and the exit status reports it (§12).
