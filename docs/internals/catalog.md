## Module

Static capability catalog (DESIGN.md §13): model → tier classification.

This is point-in-time data shipped with the binary — the no-HTTP invariant
holds, so it can only be updated by releasing. Unknown models are never
auto-selected; a pin naming one is a hard error.

## `#![forbid(`

The three governed lints are `forbid` here since #318's third round: this file
stated no level for any of them and inherited none, so each took its level
from `-D warnings` alone, which an inner `allow` the placement scan does not
read -- macro-written, or spelled apart -- lowers; #318's second MAIN review
executed exactly that in `src/plan/mod.rs` and reached `std::fs::write` from
a production topology body while clippy and every governance test passed
(`GUARD-DECISION-SILENT-PRODUCTION-FILES-OUTSIDE-THE-ROLL-CALL`). A leaf with no children (`controls/C1-unfence-catalog-single-*`).
`forbid`, not `deny`, because it compiles: nothing in the file allows a governed lint, and clippy over all targets exits 0 with the fence in place. A downgrade beneath
a `forbid` is `E0453` however it is written or generated, and the enforcement
is the lint gate's -- rustc resolves no `clippy::` lint, so `cargo build` and
`cargo test` compile what clippy refuses. `effects::tests::every_unclassified_production_file_states_each_governed_lint_or_inherits_its_forbid`
names this file the day the fence is removed, and
`every_fence_of_a_governed_lint_forbids_wherever_forbid_would_compile` the
day it drops to `deny`.

## `pub enum Family {`

Which lab trained the model, independent of which CLI serves it.

§11.3's cross-vendor second opinion turns on this and **not** on the agent
id: Copilot serves Anthropic models too, so `claude-code/claude-opus-5` and
`copilot/claude-opus-5` are a harness switch that shares every blind spot.
"Different families share fewer blind spots" is the whole claim, so family
is what the binder compares.

Assigned explicitly per entry rather than inferred from the model name. This
is hand-maintained data, and a prefix heuristic that silently misclassifies
one rename would quietly pair a reviewer with its own family — a verification
property failing without a symptom.

## `const EXAMPLE_SMALL: CatalogEntry = entry(`

Preview default per tier when no pin applies (also listed in [`CATALOG`]).

## `pub const CATALOG: &[CatalogEntry] = &[`

Snapshot of Claude Code and Copilot CLI rosters as of Aug 2026.

**Table order is preference order.** [`different_family_at`] returns the
first match, so moving an entry up promotes it for cross-family review.

The Copilot half was checked against GitHub's supported-models reference on
2026-08-09; plain `gpt-5` and `gemini-2.5-pro` had already left the roster
and were replaced (see the entries). Slugs churn faster than releases do, so
treat every name here as point-in-time: `upstroke connect` cross-checks the
roster against what the installed CLI advertises wherever that CLI can
actually enumerate models. Claude Code and Copilot cannot today; Codex's
local `debug models` catalog is validated during its probe.

## `EXAMPLE_FRONTIER,`

Keep the current frontier model ahead of retained older slugs: this
order is the binding preference used by `different_family_at`, not just
display order. Exact model names keep frozen runs reproducible; the
moving `opus` alias must not decide which model a run meant after the
fact.

## `entry("copilot", "gemini-3.1-pro", Tier::Mid, Family::Google),`

Slug pattern-derived, not verbatim: GitHub's reference lists the model as
"Gemini 3.1 Pro" and writes dots inside versions elsewhere
(`claude-sonnet-4.6`), but no example spells this one out. Lower
confidence than the entries around it — the `connect` cross-check is what
is meant to catch it once a CLI can enumerate models.

## `entry("copilot", "gpt-5.3-codex", Tier::Frontier, Family::OpenAI),`

Verbatim from GitHub's CLI programmatic reference, where it appears as a
`--model` example — the highest exact-slug confidence available without
enumeration. It is also load-bearing: `different_family_at` picks it for
every cross-vendor second opinion at frontier, so a wrong name here fails
§11.3 reviews at runtime on exactly the paths blast radius protects.

## `entry("codex", "gpt-5.6-sol", Tier::Frontier, Family::OpenAI),`

Read from a live session's own rollout on 2026-08-11 rather than from a
docs page — the highest confidence any entry in this table has, since it
is the string the CLI recorded for a turn it actually ran. Frontier
because that is what it is and what it is for: the whole point of this
pool is implementing at the top rung without the reviewer's window
paying for it (§23.2, as scoped there).

## `pub fn example_binding(tier: Tier) -> CatalogEntry {`

Catalog-derived example binding shown by the binder preview.

## `pub fn different_family_at(`

The model §11.3's cross-vendor second opinion binds to: same tier, a
different training family, and an agent this build can actually drive.

First match in [`CATALOG`] order wins, so the choice is deterministic and
the table is where the preference is expressed. `has_adapter` is injected
rather than read from the registry so the engine can ask about the adapters
its own harness holds — which, under test, is not the built-in set.

`None` means this build cannot second-opinion that tier at all. Callers
decide what that costs: a configured `second_opinion` refuses the run, while
the implicit anti-self-review rebind settles for a warning.

## `pub fn missing_from(agent: &str, advertised: &[String]) -> Vec<&'static str> {`

Catalog entries for `agent` that the installed CLI does not advertise.

The guard the step-9 review asked for, and the reason `Discovery.models`
exists: this table is hand-maintained point-in-time data, and two of its
entries had already gone stale by Aug 2026 — including the one
[`different_family_at`] picks for every frontier second opinion, where a
wrong slug fails §11.3 review at runtime on exactly the blast-radius paths
the second opinion exists to protect.

**`advertised` is empty on both adapters today** (neither CLI enumerates
models non-interactively), and an empty list means *the CLI said nothing*,
not *the CLI has no models* — so it returns nothing rather than condemning
the whole roster. The check fires when a future CLI grows enumeration;
`Caps::model_list` is what gates asking at all.

## `fn missing_from` › `let overlap = CATALOG`

Zero overlap is a format mismatch, not a stale catalog. GitHub's own
reference writes display names ("GPT-5.3-Codex", "Gemini 3.1 Pro") beside
the slugs `--model` takes, so a listing command that prints the former
would make every entry look missing — and a guard that names the entire
roster on its first real firing, advising an upgrade that cannot help, is
worse than no guard. One match is enough to trust the comparison.

## `fn normalize(model: &str) -> String {`

Case and separators folded away, so `GPT-5.3-Codex`, `gpt-5.3-codex` and
`GPT 5.3 Codex` all compare equal. Slugs are the contract, but a listing
meant for humans is not obliged to use them.

## `fn a_cli_that_enumerates_models_is_cross_checked_against_the_catalog` › `assert!(missing_from("copilot", &[]).is_empty());`

Silence is not disagreement: a CLI that advertises nothing must not
read as one that has repudiated the whole roster.

## `fn a_cli_that_enumerates_models_is_cross_checked_against_the_catalog` › `assert!(!missing.contains(&"claude-haiku-4-5"));`

Scoped to the agent asked about — Claude Code's roster is not
evidence about Copilot's.

## `fn a_second_opinion_crosses_families_not_merely_vendors()` › `let picked = different_family_at(Tier::Frontier, Family::Anthropic, everything)`

The trap this exists to avoid: `copilot/claude-opus-5` is a different
AGENT at the same tier, so an agent-id comparison would happily pick
it — and the "different families share fewer blind spots" claim
(§11.3) would be silently untrue.

## `fn a_second_opinion_crosses_families_not_merely_vendors()` › `let picked = different_family_at(Tier::Frontier, Family::OpenAI, everything)`

Asked from the other side, it comes back to Anthropic.

## `fn a_tier_with_no_reachable_other_family_resolves_to_nothing` › `let claude_only = |agent: &str| agent == "claude-code";`

The single-vendor install: only claude-code has an adapter, and every
claude-code entry is Anthropic. Callers must handle this rather than
quietly pairing a model with itself.

## `fn every_entry_declares_a_family_consistent_with_its_name()` › `for e in CATALOG {`

Families are assigned by hand, so this is the guard against a typo in
the table rather than a naming rule the code relies on anywhere.
