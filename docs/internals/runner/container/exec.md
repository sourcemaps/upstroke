# `src/runner/container/exec.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/runner/container/exec.rs`](../../../../src/runner/container/exec.rs).

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/sourcemaps/upstroke/blob/master/src/runner/container/exec.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does; this file is the whole of its prose, moved out of
the source verbatim. Each section is headed by the line of code the comment sat above, spelled
as it is in the source, so the heading is the grep string that finds the code.

## Module

The container [`Runner`]: mounts, environment, supervision, and the one
path every container invocation of a run takes.

DESIGN.md:118 gives a runner "cwd, mounts, environment, supervision, and
timeout, never agent semantics or Git", and DESIGN.md:612 narrows what this
one may know: "the runner learns nothing about agent semantics beyond
**which per-agent credential volume to mount**". That sentence is the whole
design of this module — the only agent-shaped thing in it is a volume name
taken from the run's recorded `RunnerPolicy`.

#### Everything goes through one function, and that is load-bearing

DESIGN.md:263: "**Probe and execution compose the same base, mounts,
reserved values, and overlay**, so pre-flight certifies the environment that
will actually spend." The natural implementation is two call sites that
happen to agree today, and it satisfies the sentence by accident until
somebody edits one of them. Here there is one: [`ContainerRunner::run`], and
the `RunnerPreflight` shell probe reaches it through
[`crate::runner::host::run_shell_probe`] — a free function over `&dyn
Runner`, written by PR4 for exactly this and not re-implemented here.
`tests::probe_and_execution_compose_through_one_code_path` counts the
composition sites in this module's production region and asserts there is
one.

#### Ordering, and why this module does not call [`super::launch`]

`slice_contract.side_effect_vs_event_ordering`: "no events; **intent synced
before docker create**; container created from the recorded id and
**verified before start**; **view mounted before start**; stop/rm, view
removal, intent removal after completion". Four independently droppable
predicates, and [`ContainerRunner::launch`] performs them in one place with
[`super::runtime::ContainerTrace`] recording the sequence.

[`super::launch`] performs the same four sites in the order
`WriteIntent -> Create -> MountGitView -> Start`, which satisfies every
clause above and **cannot produce a working container**: the Git view is a
**bind-mount source** of the `docker create` call, and a bind source must
exist when the container is created. Measured against `docker` 29.7.2 —
`invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist` —
which is what `real_docker_a_git_dependent_gate_sees_only_the_role_view`
reported the first time it ran. So the order here is
`WriteIntent -> MountGitView -> Create(+verify) -> Start`, which holds all
four clauses *and* works, and the eight site-taking APIs are called
directly rather than through a convenience whose order this caller cannot
use. The one-line repair to `super::launch` is
`PR6A-LAUNCH-MOUNTS-THE-VIEW-AFTER-CREATE` in the report; it is a lane F
file and is not changed from here.

**`T-CONTAINER.boundary` reads "docker start issued; Git view mounted" and
the contract clause reads the opposite.** `RECONCILIATION-OBLIGATION.md` §C1
rules that `side_effect_vs_event_ordering` governs, and the measurement
above is a third, independent reason: a bind mount is declared at `create`
and cannot be added to a running container, so `T-CONTAINER`'s prose order
is not merely non-conforming — it does not run.

## `#![deny(`

`PR6-LANEF-004`: the Container funnel's module-level allow is an INNER
attribute, and a Rust lint level is scoped by the MODULE TREE rather than by
the file, so every out-of-line child of `runner::container` inherited it --
measured, a `ContainerRuntime::start` planted in a child module passed
`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`. Re-denying here
is what makes `decisions.effect_site_inventory.mechanism` (1)'s BUILD error
true of a lane's module, which is the leg the source census cannot supply.
Enforced for every file in this directory by `runner::container::tests::
every_child_module_of_the_container_funnel_states_its_own_lint_level`.

## `pub const OUTPUT_LIMIT_BYTES: usize = 16 * 1024 * 1024;`

How much of a container's output is captured.

The host funnel bounds capture at 16 MiB per stream and terminates the tree
that exceeds it (`agent::proc`). A container runtime hands back whatever the
container wrote, so the bound is applied here — and the container is stopped
and removed either way, which is the same disposition the host's supervisor
reaches. Without it `ProcessOutput::output_limited` would be `false` for
every container invocation and
[`crate::runner::host::run_shell_probe`]'s bounded-output refusal would be
unreachable at this boundary while remaining reachable at the other — a
pre-flight that certifies less than the one it is paired with.

## `pub const SUPERVISION_POLL: Duration = Duration::from_millis(25);`

How often the supervisor asks whether the container has finished.

`decisions.tests_acceptance.determinism` forbids sleeps in the suite, so
this is a value and every test sets it to zero. A container that finishes
between two observations is observed at the second; a container that does
not finish by the request's deadline is stopped and removed.

## `pub struct RunIdentity {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who owns the containers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub struct RunIdentity {`

The run whose containers these are.

The five fields the intent record carries that are properties of the *run*
rather than of the invocation — `crash_reconstruction`'s "owner run id, run
directory (public path), coordinator incarnation id, repo key" plus the
private root the namespace lives under. The sixth and seventh, the
invocation and the runner digest, come from the request and the policy.

## `pub struct RunIdentity` › `pub private_root: PathBuf,`

`<R>` — the run's **recorded** private root.

## `pub struct RunIdentity` › `pub run_id: String,`

The owner run id.

## `pub struct RunIdentity` › `pub run_dir: PathBuf,`

The owner's **public** run directory.

## `pub struct RunIdentity` › `pub incarnation: String,`

The coordinator incarnation id: a per-process ULID, never read from a
lock file.

## `pub struct RunIdentity` › `pub repo_key: String,`

The repo key.

## `pub const fn receives_a_worktree(role: &ExecutionRole) -> bool {`

Whether this role receives its role's worktree.

DESIGN.md:400: "A container receives only **its role's one worktree** mount".
A probe has no worktree. [`crate::agent::probe_workspace`]'s own words are
"a probe asks a CLI about itself and **has no workspace of its own**", and
the value it returns is the **coordinator's current working directory** —
which at the host boundary is harmless and at this one is the repository
itself: the public log and authoritative Git in a single mount. So a probe's
container receives no worktree, no Git projection and no working directory,
and certifies exactly what a probe is for: that the recorded shell, or the
recorded agent CLI, runs inside the recorded image.

This is a **boundary** decision, which is what DESIGN.md:118 gives a runner
("owns cwd, mounts, environment"), not a change to what a probe *is*: the
request, its role, its slot accounting and its `InvocationId` are untouched,
and the same request executes on the host exactly as it did before.
`PR6A-PROBE-WORKSPACE-IS-THE-COORDINATORS-CWD` in the report records the
other half — that a caller which wants a probe to have a workspace has no
way to say so.

Exhaustive with no wildcard: a role added later has to be classified here.

## `pub enum Withheld {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The negative space
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub enum Withheld {`

What a container must never receive.

DESIGN.md:400 names three — "A container receives only its role's one
worktree mount; it never receives **the public log**, **sibling worktrees**,
or **private artifacts**" — and DESIGN.md:612 names the fourth: "Workers,
repository-controlled gates, and reviewers all cross the boundary;
**authoritative Git** and the event log never do."

An enumeration rather than a list of paths, because the paths are derived
per run and the *categories* are what the passages fix. A category added
later has to name its passage here.

## `pub enum Withheld` › `PublicLog,`

`<repo>/.upstroke/runs/<run-id>` — `events.jsonl`, the frozen plan,
questions, answers, artifacts.

## `pub enum Withheld` › `SiblingWorktree,`

Every other role's worktree of this run, and the integration staging
worktree.

## `pub enum Withheld` › `PrivateArtifacts,`

`<R>/runs/<run-id>` — transcripts, reviews, per-attempt settings, gate
logs — and `<R>/containers`, which is every container's ownership
evidence.

## `pub enum Withheld` › `AuthoritativeGit,`

The repository's shared Git directory: every engine ref, and the
coordinator's own `HEAD`.

## `impl Withheld` › `pub const ALL: &'static [Self] = &[`

All four. Written out so a grid over categories is a grid over all of
them.

## `impl Withheld` › `pub const fn passage(self) -> &'static str {`

The passage that withholds it.

## `pub struct Confinement {`

The host paths one run withholds from every container of that run.

Built from [`RunPaths`] and [`crate::workspace_manager::execution_root_of`]
rather than from a list written here, so a layout change moves this set with
it. That is the point: "a test that checks *the worktree is mounted* passes
on a container that also mounts `/`", and a hand-written forbidden list
passes on a layout that has moved.
**There is no empty `Confinement` and no `Default`**, which is the repair
for `PR6-CORRECTNESS-011` / `PR6-ENUM-002`: [`Self::of_run`] is the only
constructor, so a `ContainerRunner` that withholds nothing is not a value
this module can produce. The shape is `PR4-CONF-003`'s — the property is
established by the function that derives it from the layout, not asserted by
a caller who remembered to call a builder.

## `impl Confinement` › `pub fn of_run(identity: &RunIdentity, repo_root: &Path) -> Self {`

Everything `identity`'s run withholds.

Derived from the types that own the layout — [`RunPaths`] for the run's
two halves and [`crate::workspace_manager::execution_root_of`] plus
[`crate::workspace_manager::Slot`] for the worktree namespaces — so this
set moves when the layout moves. `run` adds one more per invocation: the
workspace's **resolved** common Git directory, which is where a linked
worktree's refs really are rather than where an assumed `<repo>/.git`
would be.

#### The sibling-worktree namespace (`PR6-CORRECTNESS-013`)

DESIGN.md:400 is "A container receives only **its role's one worktree**
mount; it never receives … **sibling worktrees**". Until repair R1 this
helper named no worktree path at all and every fixture added its own
siblings by hand, so a Gate handed the run's **execution root** as its
workspace was accepted and received every task and merge worktree in one
mount.

The check below is "a mount is, or is an ancestor of, a withheld path",
so withholding the execution root refuses a mount of it or of anything
above it. That leaves one directory level between the root and a
worktree — `<root>/tasks`, `<root>/merge`, `<root>/snapshots` — which is
*inside* the root and still contains two worktrees, so each namespace
directory is withheld as well. They are derived from `Slot::relative()`
rather than written out: `Slot` is the type that decides where a
worktree lives, and a hand-written list is a list that keeps passing
after the layout has moved.

What is deliberately **not** refused is a mount of one worktree that
happens to be another role's. The runner mounts the one workspace the
request names and cannot tell "mine" from "a sibling"; which worktree a
role gets is the engine's decision, and DESIGN.md:400's clause is about
receiving *more than one*.

## `impl Confinement` › `pub fn withholding(mut self, category: Withheld, path: impl Into<PathBuf>) -> Self {`

Withhold one more path under `category`.

## `impl Confinement` › `pub fn entries(&self) -> &[(Withheld, PathBuf)] {`

Every withheld path, with its category.

## `impl Confinement` › `pub fn violations(&self, mounts: &[Mount]) -> Vec<String> {`

Which of `mounts` would hand a withheld path to the container.

A mount **is** a withheld path, or is an **ancestor** of one. The
ancestor half is the whole check: a container that mounts the repository
root has mounted the public log, and a container that mounts `/` has
mounted everything. A membership test — "is the public log in the mount
list" — passes on both.

## `pub fn violations(&self, mounts: &[Mount]) -> Vec<String>` › `let Mount::Path { source, target, .. } = mount else {`

A named volume has no host path, so it can carry none of these.

## `fn worktree_namespaces(execution_root: &Path) -> Vec<PathBuf> {`

`<execution root>/{tasks, merge, snapshots}` — the directories one level
above a worktree, each of which holds several.

Derived from [`crate::workspace_manager::Slot::relative`], which is the
function that decides where a worktree lives, by taking the first component
of one representative path per variant. Deduplicated and sorted, so two
variants sharing a namespace would collapse rather than double.

## `pub fn recorded_image_id(policy: &RunnerPolicy) -> Result<&str, UpstrokeError> {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The recorded policy, read for what this runner needs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub fn recorded_image_id(policy: &RunnerPolicy) -> Result<&str, UpstrokeError> {`

The recorded immutable image id.

INV-23: "every container of every epoch is created from **the recorded image
id** … so a moved reference cannot change what executes". The reference is
deliberately not read here and is not carried into [`CreateSpec`], which has
no field for one.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when the policy is not a container policy or
records no image.

## `pub fn recorded_volumes(policy: &RunnerPolicy) -> BTreeMap<String, String> {`

The recorded per-agent credential volume names, or an empty map.

## `pub struct InvocationPlan {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The runner
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub struct InvocationPlan {`

What one request becomes before anything is created.

Returned by [`ContainerRunner::plan`] so a test can inspect the mounts, the
environment and the create spec **without** a runtime — which is what makes
the mount and environment obligations assertable on a machine with no
container runtime at all, including the Windows guest.

## `pub struct InvocationPlan` › `pub launch: LaunchPlan,`

The launch sequence's own plan: name, intent, create spec, view request.

## `pub struct InvocationPlan` › `pub git: Option<view::GitLayout>,`

The Git layout the view projects, when the workspace is a worktree.

## `impl InvocationPlan` › `pub fn mounts(&self) -> &[Mount] {`

The mounts this container receives.

## `impl InvocationPlan` › `pub fn env(&self) -> &[(String, String)] {`

The environment this container receives.

## `struct Reached {`

How far a launch got before it failed, and therefore what has to be
released.

The intent is not a field: every exit of [`ContainerRunner::launch`] that
can fail is *after* the intent is written, and `remove_intent` is
idempotent, so releasing it is unconditional. A boolean for it would be a
field with one value.

## `struct Reached` › `view: Option<PathBuf>,`

The R19 view directory, when it was materialised.

## `struct Reached` › `container: ContainerReached,`

How far the container itself got.

## `enum ContainerReached {`

`NotCreated`: `docker create` was not attempted, so no container can
exist. `Created`: it was attempted — the daemon may have created one
before the answer was lost — and `docker start` was not, so whatever
exists holds no process. `Started`: `docker start` was attempted, so the
container may be running. The three are what [`ContainerRunner::cancelled`]
classifies the process by: the review of `79ddbffb` found a boolean "may
have been created" conflated with "may be running", so Docker down before
`docker create` was `Unresolved` (an outage no defer ever counted) and a
committed `docker start` with a clean cancel was `NeverStarted`
(`PR8-R3-CONTAINER-START`).

## `impl Reached` › `const INTENT_ONLY: Self = Self {`

The intent is written and nothing else exists.

## `pub struct ContainerRunner {`

The `Container` / `container-v1` [`Runner`].

Holds the **recorded** `RunnerPolicy` rather than resolving one: resolution
by read-only inspection is a separate obligation (INV-23, "resolved once by
read-only inspection before the worktree lock"), and a runner that resolved
its own policy could not be rebuilt from a record — which is what every
later incarnation does.

## `pub struct ContainerRunner` › `view_is_explicit: bool,`

Whether [`ContainerRunner::with_view`] replaced the default projection.

The default view has to be rebuilt whenever the layout or the observer
moves — its alternate names the object store's in-container target and
its trace is the observer's — and a builder whose result depended on the
order its setters were called in is a builder that is wrong half the
time. So the default is rebuilt by every setter and an explicit one
never is.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub fn new(`

A runner for `identity`'s run in `repo_root`, executing in `policy`'s
recorded image and composing over `environment`.

**`repo_root` and `environment` are parameters and not builder calls,
and that is the repair for `PR6-CORRECTNESS-011` / `PR6-ENUM-002`.** The
confinement is computed here, from [`Confinement::of_run`], so there is
no construction that yields a runner withholding nothing — the previous
default was `Confinement::none()` with the real set added by an
*optional* `with_confinement`, and a caller who forgot it got a runner
that would mount the run's own public log for a Gate. The builder is
gone; a caller who wants to withhold *more* uses
[`Self::also_withholding`], which can only add.

`environment` is mandatory for the same reason at the other boundary:
the default was `ContainerEnvironment::inherited()`, an empty base, so
the runner supplied no `PATH` at all and the image's own — possibly
carrying a working-directory-relative component — decided which binary a
bare program name resolved to (`PR6-CORRECTNESS-006`). DESIGN.md:260
says the runner "supplies role-scoped `HOME`, `PATH`, and credential
locations"; a runner that read no base could supply none of them.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when `policy` is not a usable container policy
— see [`recorded_image_id`].

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub fn with_layout(mut self, layout: BoundaryLayout) -> Self {`

Use an explicit boundary layout, and point the Git view's alternate at
its object mount.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub fn also_withholding(mut self, category: Withheld, path: impl Into<PathBuf>) -> Self {`

Withhold one **more** path from every container this runner starts.

Monotone by construction: it appends to the set
[`Confinement::of_run`] derived and there is no setter that replaces it,
so no call sequence can leave a runner withholding less than its run
does.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub fn with_hooks(mut self, hooks: Box<dyn ContainerHooks + Send>) -> Self {`

Observe (and, for the fault subset, inject at) every container site this
runner reaches.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub fn with_view(mut self, view: Box<dyn GitView>) -> Self {`

Use an explicit Git view implementation.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `fn rebuild_view(&mut self) {`

Put the default projection back in step with the layout and the
observer. A no-op once [`Self::with_view`] has replaced it.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub const fn with_poll(mut self, poll: Duration) -> Self {`

How often the supervisor asks whether the container has finished.
`Duration::ZERO` is what the suite sets: no sleeps.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub const fn with_output_limit(mut self, bytes: usize) -> Self {`

Bound the captured output at `bytes`.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub const fn policy(&self) -> &RunnerPolicy {`

The record this runner executes under.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub fn policy_digest(&self) -> &str {`

`runner_policy_sha256` of [`Self::policy`] — every container intent
carries it.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub const fn layout(&self) -> &BoundaryLayout {`

The boundary layout.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub const fn environment(&self) -> &ContainerEnvironment {`

The environment contract this runner composes under.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub const fn confinement(&self) -> &Confinement {`

What this run withholds from every container.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub fn plan(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<InvocationPlan, UpstrokeError> {`

Everything one request becomes, without performing any effect.

**This is the composition site**, and there is one: `Runner::run` calls
it and so does every test that inspects a mount set, so a mount or an
environment key that pre-flight sees and the spending invocation does
not is not expressible.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when the overlay names a reserved key, when the
container name cannot be built from the request's identity, or when the
mount plan would hand the container a withheld path.

## `pub fn plan(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<Invoc…` › `let intent = ContainerIntent::new(`

`ContainerIntent::new` encodes the run directory (`PR6-RECOV-001`).
The rendering this replaced was `to_string_lossy().replace('\\',
"/")`, which on Unix mapped `<repo>\a/runs/X` — a real directory,
since a backslash is an ordinary filename byte there — onto
`<repo>/a/runs/X`, a *different* real directory. A foreign census
then probed the wrong `run.lock`, found none, and killed a live run's
container. `intent::path_label` carries the argument.

## `pub fn plan(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<Invoc…` › `confinement =`

The worktree's *resolved* common directory, which is where a
linked worktree's refs really are — rather than an assumed
`<repo>/.git`.

## `pub fn plan(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<Invoc…` › `image_id: self.image_id.clone(),`

INV-23: the recorded **id**, never the reference.

## `pub fn plan(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<Invoc…` › `workdir: Some(if receives_a_worktree(&request.role) {`

Always a value, never the image's own choice. A role
with a worktree runs in it; a probe, which has none,
runs in the ephemeral scratch mount — a directory that
exists in every image because this runner declares it,
that is writable under a read-only root, and that
carries nothing. `PR6-CORRECTNESS-006`: leaving this
`None` for probes handed the working directory to the
image's `WORKDIR`, so what a probe certified depended on
a value the runner had not read.

## `pub fn plan(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<Invoc…` › `read_only_root: true,`

`expected_failures_refusals[5]`, for every role. A
reviewer's `:ro` worktree is not the whole of "read-only"
if the container layer around it is writable, and a gate
is "repository-controlled code which no agent permission
surface can ever bound" (DESIGN.md:610).

## `pub fn plan(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<Invoc…` › `workspace: if receives_a_worktree(&request.role) {`

R19 is "per container invocation (**incl. shell and agent
probes**)", so a probe gets its view directory too — and
it has nothing to project. `GitViewRequest` has no
"project nothing" state, so the request names a directory
that is not a worktree, which is what the projection
already treats as "no repository here". Recorded as a
seam note rather than worked around silently.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `fn mounts(`

The mounts this request's role receives, and no others.

DESIGN.md:400: "A container receives **only its role's one worktree
mount**". Four kinds, and each is here because a live passage puts it
here:

1. the role's **one** worktree, `:ro` for a reviewer — DESIGN.md:610's
   "a `:ro` mount makes the reviewer's read-only *mechanically* perfect
   instead of flag-deep";
2. the disposable Git view, over the worktree's own `.git` —
   DESIGN.md:612;
3. the object store the view borrows, **read-only** — the same sentence;
4. this agent's credential volume, for the roles that execute an agent
   CLI — DESIGN.md:612's "which per-agent credential volume to mount",
   and R20's "persistent volumes, not ephemeral copies", so it is
   writable: "some CLIs rotate refresh tokens on use, and a discarded
   rotation forces re-login".

(2) and (3) are absent when the workspace is not a worktree — a probe's
scratch directory — and (4) is absent for a role
[`supplies_credential_location`] refuses. Nothing else is ever added,
which is the positive half of the confinement claim; the negative half
is [`Confinement::violations`].

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `let source = if layout.dot_git_is_file {`

The overlay at `<workspace>/.git`. A bind mount's source and its
target must be the same kind — measured against `docker` 29.7.2,
which fails `runc create` with "Are you trying to mount a
directory onto a file" — so a linked worktree (a `.git` file)
receives the one-line pointer file and a main worktree (a `.git`
directory) receives the view directory itself. Either way what a
tool finds at `<workspace>/.git` is the disposable view.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `mounts.push(Mount::Tmpfs {`

(5) the ephemeral scratch surface, for **every** role. With
`CreateSpec::read_only_root` the container's own layer is closed, so
without this a `sh -c` gate could not write a temporary file and
`git` could not write its own. It carries no host source, so it is
the one writable surface that is neither the role's nor the
coordinator's — which is what keeps "gate write outside mount fails"
a claim about a mount list rather than about a hole.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `pub fn credential_volume_for(`

The credential volume this request's role would be given, if any.

Exposed so the mount rule and [`supplies_credential_location`] can be
asserted to be **the same predicate** rather than two rules that agree
today.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `fn launch(`

The four sites `side_effect_vs_event_ordering` puts before the
invocation, in the order it states and in the order a container runtime
can execute.

> intent synced before docker create; container created from the
> recorded id and verified before start; view mounted before start

The Git view is materialised **before** `Container.Create` because it is
a bind-mount source of that call and a bind source must exist when the
container is created — see the module docs. Every clause the contract
states still holds: the intent is synced before the create, the reported
image id is verified before the start, and the view is mounted before
the start.

**This is also what makes "container start without an intent is
impossible by construction"** (`expected_failures_refusals[6]`) true of
the shape a caller uses: the only sequence in this module that reaches
`Container.Start` begins by writing the intent.

#### Every way out of this function releases what it reached

`PR6-CORRECTNESS-003` / `PR6-ENUM-003`. There are four exits and until
repair R1 only one of them cleaned up:

| fails at | reached | released before |
|---|---|---|
| `MountGitView` | intent | — nothing did |
| `Create` | intent, view | — nothing did |
| reported id mismatch | intent, view, container | fail-**fast**: a failing `Stop` skipped the rm, the view and the intent *and masked the integrity refusal* |
| `Start` | intent, view, container | — nothing did |

R26 is "released on complete (stop/rm, view removed, intent removed),
**cancel**, or shutdown" and R19 is "pruned on complete or **cancel**".
A `?` that returns without a [`Launched`] value returns without anything
for `Runner::run`'s own release to act on, so each of those exits left a
container, a view and an intent for the census to find. Every exit now
goes through [`Self::cancel`], which attempts **every** step even after
one fails and answers what it could not release; the error returned is
always the *original* one with that residue appended, because "docker
stop said no" is never the thing to report instead of "the runtime
executed a substituted image".

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when the reported image id differs from the
record, or whatever a step returns.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `let written = match write_intent(`

The **fifth** exit (`PR6-ACCT-003`). R1's table began at
`MountGitView` because a `write_intent` that fails has written
nothing — which is true only of a failure at the `Before` phase. The
funnel runs its primitive and *then* consults the `After` phase, and
`IntentWritten::certify` reads the published record back, so a
failure here is a durable R26 record with no container and no view:
residue a census has to reclaim, from a launch that never launched.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `return Err(self.cancelled(`

**The view path, not `INTENT_ONLY`** (`PR6-ACCT-003`). The
funnel runs its primitive and then consults the `After`
phase, so a `MountGitView` that fails may have materialised
the directory first — and the `Err` arm carries no path to
say so. The request's own `path` is where it would be, and
`GitView::discard` is idempotent and tolerant of
already-gone, so naming it costs a no-op in the `Before` cell
and is the difference between a pruned R19 directory and an
orphan in the `After` one. Measured: with `INTENT_ONLY` here,
arming `MountGitView`'s `After` phase left a view behind and
removed the intent that was the only handle on it.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `return Err(self.cancelled(`

`container: true`, for the reason the view path is named
above (`PR6-ACCT-003`): a `Container.Create` that fails at
the `After` phase has already created the container, and the
real equivalent is a `docker create` that succeeds and whose
following inspect fails — `DockerCli::create` reads the
reported image id back, and that read can fail on a container
that exists. `stop` and `remove` are both tolerant of
already-gone (`settle_stop`, `settle_remove`), so this is a
pair of no-ops when nothing was created. Measured: with
`NotCreated` here, arming `Create`'s `After` phase left
the container behind. `Created` and not `Started`: whatever
exists was never started, so the fate is `NeverStarted`
whatever the cancel then manages.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `let refusal = ImageIdMismatch::of(&plan.invocation).error(`

R2's error type, R1's cleanup. The two lanes repaired this one
path for different findings: R2 made a mid-run mismatch
*distinguishable* from a pre-flight one (they were the same
generic Refused), and R1 made the cleanup attempt **every** step
instead of stopping at the first failure and masking the
integrity error underneath it. Both are needed, so the
distinguishable error is the `cause` R1's `cancelled` carries.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `fn cancelled(`

Release what a failed launch reached and answer `cause` with whatever
could not be released appended, as a `RunnerError` whose fate is decided
by how far the launch got and by what the cancel established — two facts
kept apart. Before `docker start` was attempted (`NotCreated`, `Created`)
the fate is `NeverStarted` whatever the cancel achieved: a created but
never started container holds no process, and a `docker create` whose
answer was lost cannot have started one either. Whether the start was
attempted is the funnel's to say ([`super::StartFailure`]): a refusal at
`Container.Start`'s `Before` phase never issued `docker start`, so the
launch stays at `Created` — the cover review of `8a5f59e8` found every
start failure recorded as `Started` (`PR8-R4-START-NOT-ATTEMPTED`).
 Once `docker start` was
attempted (`Started`) the cancel's evidence decides — `Gone` when the
runtime confirmed a stop or a forced removal, `Unresolved` when it
confirmed neither, and an answer that another reclaimer's removal is in
progress confirms neither (`Settled::RemovalInProgress`, the daemon sets
that flag before it kills) — because at this seam a start the daemon
refused cannot be told from a start whose acknowledgement was lost.
 A refused start whose
cancel completes therefore settles as an `Infrastructure{Other}` outage
with the refusal in its detail rather than as `RunnerSpawnFailure`; both
defer identically. The review of `79ddbffb` measured both directions of
the previous rule wrong (`PR8-R3-CONTAINER-START`).

The answer is never the cleanup's own failure: an operator holding "the
container could not be stopped" instead of "the runtime executed a
substituted image" has been handed the symptom and not the diagnosis.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `fn cancel(`

Stop, remove, unmount and remove-intent for whatever `reached` says
exists, **attempting every step even after one fails**.

`PR6-LANEF-006`'s shape, applied to the runner's own launch rather than
to `super::launch`: with `?` in place a failing `Container.Stop` left
the container, the view and the intent behind — three residues from one
failure. `docker rm --force` removes a running container, so `Remove`
after a failed `Stop` is not a wasted call.

**The body is [`super::cancel_reached`] and nothing else**
(`PR6-ACCT-004`/`PR6-ACCT-005`): this was a second copy of the same four
steps, and the copy in `super` grew the R19 recovery-anchor rule while
this one did not. Two implementations of one cleanup rule is the shape
`PR6E-005` measured on the view-path derivation, where the two halves
were each self-consistent and nothing crossed them.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `fn release(`

"stop/rm, view removal, intent removal **after completion**", answered as
[`super::release_classified`] answers it: a failure says whether the
runtime established the container's process gone, which is what `run`
needs to classify the process, and `run` tells it whether the exit was
observed so a container seen to terminate keeps nothing back.

[`super::release`], which is the one place those four sites are
performed in that order. It was a second copy until repair round R3b,
and the copy was the fail-**fast** one: `PR6-ACCT-004` measured that a
`Container.Stop` failure on a *completed* invocation skipped the still
viable `rm`, the view prune and the intent removal, while the exhaustive
implementation the cleanup-fault grid tests lived on the other path and
never reached `Runner::run`.

### Errors

A `ReleaseFailure` whose error is [`UpstrokeError::Refused`] naming every
step that could not be completed.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `fn supervise(&self, name: &ContainerName, deadline: Instant) -> Result<bool, UpstrokeError> {`

Wait for the container, bounded by the request's own timeout.

"timeout or shutdown stops and removes the container"
(`slice_contract.cancellation`). The stop and the removal are the
caller's [`super::release`]; this decides *which* disposition.

## `pub enum ImageIdMismatch {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
INV-23's two outcomes, which differ by phase
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub enum ImageIdMismatch {`

What a created container's reported image id differing from the record
means, which depends on **when** it is observed.

`expected_failures_refusals[3]`, in full: "a created container whose
reported image id differs from the record is **refused before start
(pre-flight/rebuild)** or **settled as a `RunnerSpawnFailure` outage
(mid-run)**". Two outcomes, and the contract distinguishes them: a refusal
stops the write command before it has spent anything, and an outage defers
an already-running task's attempt without burning it
(`UnavailableOutcome::Deferred` — "an outage never fails a task on its
own").

The shipped code returned one [`UpstrokeError::Refused`] for both, so a caller
could not tell the two phases apart and the mid-run half of the clause was
unreachable — `PR6-CORRECTNESS-001`. The *settlement event* is PR7's
(`invariants_introduced`: the container transition is "test-only until PR7
wires `TopologyRun`"), and `src/topology/**` is frozen; what this slice owes
is that the two phases arrive at a caller as **different things**, so PR7
has something to map. This is that thing.

**The phase is read from the invocation and nothing else.** A
[`InvocationId::Probe`] is a `RunnerPreflight` container — the pre-flight
and rebuild path, which by construction runs before any work — and an
[`InvocationId::Attempt`] or [`InvocationId::Sequence`] is a worker, gate or
reviewer invocation inside a run that is already spending. Deriving it from
anything else (a flag on the runner, a phase the caller passes) would let
the two disagree.

## `pub enum ImageIdMismatch` › `RefusedBeforeStart,`

Pre-flight or rebuild: **refuse before start**, before any spend.

## `pub enum ImageIdMismatch` › `SpawnFailureOutage,`

Mid-run: the invocation could not be spawned on the recorded boundary,
which the run settles as a `RunnerSpawnFailure` outage.

## `impl ImageIdMismatch` › `pub const ALL: &'static [Self] = &[Self::RefusedBeforeStart, Self::SpawnFailureOutage];`

Both outcomes, so a grid over phases is a grid over all of them.

## `impl ImageIdMismatch` › `pub const fn of(invocation: &InvocationId) -> Self {`

Which outcome this invocation's mismatch has.

## `impl ImageIdMismatch` › `pub fn error(self, name: &ContainerName, reported: &str, recorded: &str) -> UpstrokeError {`

The error a caller settles from.

**The variant is the classification**, not a substring of the message: a
caller that had to grep prose to tell a refusal from an outage would be
reading an oracle nobody can keep stable. [`UpstrokeError::Agent`] is this
engine's existing channel for "the runner could not produce a usable
process" — `agent::proc` returns it for a failed spawn and
`gates::Scripted::SpawnFailure` returns it — which is the shape
`InfrastructureKind::RunnerSpawnFailure` settles.

## `impl ImageIdMismatch` › `pub const fn name(self) -> &'static str {`

As a report writes it.

## `pub fn view_dir(private_root: &Path, name: &ContainerName) -> PathBuf {`

`<R>/views/<container-name>`.

Under the run's recorded private root, beside `<R>/containers`, so a census
that reclaims an orphan container has the view path without a live
[`Launched`] — which is exactly how [`super::reclaim`] takes it.

### It delegates, and that is the whole point (`PR6E-005` / `PR6-LANEC-003`)

This module *mounts* the view; [`super::census`] *finds* it after a crash,
and the two halves were written in different lanes. **The six intent fields
the packet fixes carry no view path**, so the consumer has to *derive* it
from the private root and the container name — which means the two
derivations have to be the same derivation, and they were two copies of one
`join` with nothing asserting they agree.

Measured independently, twice: lane E changed `census::VIEWS_DIR` to
`"views-mutated"` and **all 1324 tests passed**; the lane-C review changed
only this side to `<R>/views-v2/<name>` and the entire suite passed. Each
half is self-consistent — lane C's fixtures plant orphan views through
`census::view_path` and lane A's assert this literal — and **no test crosses
them**. A real divergence leaves every orphan view unreclaimed after a
coordinator death: `resource_accounting` R19's `NoRunFinished` is "pruned at
the next write-command start after the owning container is observed
terminated", and ST-16's closing clause is "ledgers R19/R26 balance".

`census::view_path` is now the one definition and this is a delegation, so
the divergence is **unrepresentable** rather than merely untested — the shape
`PR4-CONF-003` established, where deleting a guarantee is a compile error
instead of a silent regression.
`effects::tests::the_view_directory_has_one_definition_in_the_tree` guards
against a second one being written.

## `fn run(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<ProcessOut…` › `let launched: Launched = self.launch(&mut **hooks, &plan.launch)?;`

WriteIntent -> MountGitView -> Create (+ verify the reported image
id) -> Start, in that order and in one place.

## `fn run(&self, request: &RunnerRequest) -> Result<ProcessOut…` › `let released = self.release(`

Release whatever the invocation reached, whether or not it succeeded:
R26 is "released on complete (stop/rm, view removed, intent removed),
**cancel**, or shutdown", and R19's "pruned on complete or cancel".
So the release runs on both paths. The fate the error carries is decided
by process evidence alone, and by nothing about which cleanup steps
completed: `Gone` when the supervisor observed the container terminated,
or the release confirmed a stop, or the release confirmed a forced
removal; `Unresolved` only when none of those holds — the supervisor never
saw it exit (the observation failed, or the output was a timeout) and the
runtime confirmed neither a stop nor a removal. Which error is carried is
the other question: the output's when the outcome failed, the release's
when only the release did, both when both did, with the release failure
attached as cleanup. The review of `79ddbffb` found the previous rule
reading a failed stop as "may still run" past a successful forced
removal, a timed-out output as `Unresolved` on any release failure — a
view that could not be discarded included — and an observed exit as
nothing (`PR8-R3-CONTAINER-EVIDENCE`); the release is told when the exit
was observed so it does not retain the view and intent for a container
it knows holds no process.

The reviews of `916852c9` reproduced the case this decides: Docker lost
after `start`, so observe, stop and remove all failed, and the one error
the caller saw was settled as a spawn failure — an outage terminal that
released the transaction and reclaimed the snapshot beside a gate still
running. A release that could not finish leaves residue the census
reclaims on the next resume, and that census runs before any recovery
event, so ending the command with the fate unresolved is what lets the
container be reclaimed before the verification is settled.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `fn collect(`

Collect after the supervision, which `run` performs itself so it knows
whether the exit was observed before it releases.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `let execution = self`

Collected **before** the release: `docker logs` answers for a running
container and not for a removed one, so a timed-out invocation still
reports what it printed.

## `impl ContainerRunner` › `code: if timed_out { None } else { execution.exit_code },`

A container the supervisor stopped did not exit on its own,
whatever status the runtime reports afterwards — the same
disposition `agent::proc` gives a killed tree.

## `fn refused_by_runtime(error: RuntimeError) -> UpstrokeError {`

A runtime failure, as the engine's error type.

## `fn bounded(bytes: &[u8], limit: usize) -> (String, bool) {`

`bytes` as text, truncated at `limit`, and whether it was.

## `fn bounded(bytes: &[u8], limit: usize) -> (String, bool)` › `while end > 0 && (bytes[end] & 0b1100_0000) == 0b1000_0000 {`

Do not split a UTF-8 sequence: back up to a character boundary.

## `mod tests;`

-- test-only declarations ----------------------------------------------
At the BOTTOM: `effects::production_region`, which the three censuses now in
`exec/tests.rs` still use (`effects::externally_reachable_fns` reads
`effects::production_code` since `PR7-WRAPPERS-EMPTY-DOMAIN`), cuts a source
at its first `#[cfg(test)]`
(`PR5-R1-CFG-TEST-SHRINKS-THE-DOMAIN`).

**This declaration carries no `#[allow]`, and that is a change.** While the
bodies were inline here, an outer `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` sat
above `#[cfg(test)]` and covered them. They are out of line now, in
`src/runner/container/exec/tests.rs`, which states that level for itself
because the funnel's child-module census requires a child to state one rather
than inherit it. The outer attribute was then allowing the same lint a second
time for the same module -- `clippy::duplicated_attributes` -- so it was
deleted rather than suppressed, and this file's `effects/allowlist.toml` row,
in the **funnel section**, records the empty `allows` that leaves. The
production region above keeps the file-level `#![deny(...)]`, so a lane's
production code here still cannot reach a container primitive
(`PR6-LANEF-004`). `decisions.effect_site_inventory.mechanism` (2).

**That the allow was written ABOVE `#[cfg(test)]` used to be load-bearing**,
and the history is kept because it cost a repair round. The reader that made
it so was `runner::tests::production_region`, which was line-based: it
excluded a test module by matching a line that is exactly `#[cfg(test)]`
followed by a line starting `mod `, so an attribute between the two made this
whole test region read as PRODUCTION and both
`every_production_runner_request_is_built_by_its_roles_builder` and
`every_production_command_spec_payload_is_classified` failed with these
fixtures counted as production call sites. Measured in repair round F1 and
filed as `PR6F1-RUNNER-PRODUCTION-REGION-BREAKS-ON-AN-ATTRIBUTE`. That reader
is deleted: `effects::production_code`, which those censuses share now, finds
the item's extent by delimiter matching, so it removed the module with the
attribute in either position -- measured both ways on this file -- and with
no attribute here at all there is nothing left for a reader to trip over.
