# `src/runner/container/intent.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/runner/container/intent.rs`](../../../../src/runner/container/intent.rs).

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/sourcemaps/upstroke/blob/master/src/runner/container/intent.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does; this file is the whole of its prose, moved out of
the source verbatim. Each section is headed by the line of code the comment sat above, spelled
as it is in the source, so the heading is the grep string that finds the code.

## Module

The global container intent — its six fields, its name, and its five
labels.

`decisions.admission_and_leases.permits.crash_reconstruction`, which is the
authority for every sentence in this module:

> every container invocation writes a synced intent in the global namespace
> `<R>/containers/<container-name>.intent` (R = the run's private root, the
> one recorded in `run_started.private_dir`) recording owner run id, run
> directory (public path), coordinator incarnation id, repo key, invocation
> id, and `runner_policy_sha256`; the coordinator incarnation id is a
> per-process ULID recorded in `run_started(4)`/`run_resumed(4)` and is never
> read from lock-file contents …; the container name is
> `upstroke-<repo_key>-<run_id>-<incarnation>-<invocation-hash>`, so
> deterministic `InvocationId`s never collide across incarnations and no
> earlier ownership evidence is overwritten; labels `upstroke.private_root`,
> `upstroke.run`, `upstroke.run_dir`, `upstroke.incarnation`, `upstroke.invocation`

Nothing here performs an effect. The write and the removal are funnel APIs
in `src/runner/container.rs`, under `ContainerSite::WriteIntent` and
`ContainerSite::RemoveIntent`.

#### The one thing here that is not data: [`IntentWritten`]

`expected_failures_refusals[6]` is "container start without an intent is
**impossible by construction**". Before repair R1 it was impossible by
nobody having written it: `create_container` and `start_container` were
public, took a bare [`ContainerName`], performed no inspection, and a
`start_existing(name)` added tomorrow would have compiled
(`PR6-CORRECTNESS-012` / `PR6-ENUM-001`, and catalogue survivor
`PR6-INTENT-020` reached the same clause from the other side).

[`IntentWritten`] is the capability, in the idiom `PR4-CONF-003` established
for `Contained`: the two funnel APIs that create and start a container take
one, and there are exactly two ways to obtain it — `container::write_intent`,
which writes the record, and [`IntentWritten::certify`], which **reads the
published record back and parses it**. A private field alone would not do
it: Rust privacy makes a private item of `runner::container` visible to
every child module of `runner::container`, which is where the lanes are, so
the proof is grounded in the filesystem instead of in visibility. Forging
one therefore requires writing a well-formed intent record at
`<R>/containers/<name>.intent` — which is writing the intent.

## `#![forbid(`

`PR6-LANEF-004`: the Container funnel's module-level allow is an INNER
attribute, and a Rust lint level is scoped by the MODULE TREE rather than by
the file, so every out-of-line child of `runner::container` inherited it --
measured, a `ContainerRuntime::start` planted in a child module passed
`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`. Re-denying here
is what makes `decisions.effect_site_inventory.mechanism` (1)'s BUILD error
true of a lane's module, which is the leg the source census cannot supply.
Enforced for every file in this directory by `runner::container::tests::
every_child_module_of_the_container_funnel_states_its_own_lint_level`.

## `pub const CONTAINERS_DIR: &str = "containers";`

The directory of the global namespace, under the run's recorded private
root.

## `pub const INTENT_SUFFIX: &str = ".intent";`

The suffix of one intent record.

## `pub const INTENT_STAGED_SUFFIX: &str = ".intent.tmp";`

The staging suffix. The record is published by rename, like every other
durable record this engine writes.

## `pub const NAME_PREFIX: &str = "upstroke";`

The name's fixed prefix.

## `pub const NAME_SEPARATOR: char = '-';`

The separator between the name's components.

A component may not contain it — [`validate_component`] refuses one that
does — which is what makes [`ContainerName::parse`] injective.

## `pub const INVOCATION_HASH_DOMAIN: &str = "upstroke.container-invocation.v1";`

The domain tag of the invocation hash.

Domain-separated so the same bytes hashed for another purpose are a
different value, in the idiom of `workspace_manager::repo_key_v1` and
`runner::policy::CANONICAL_VERSION`.

## `pub const INVOCATION_HASH_HEX_CHARS: usize = 16;`

How many hex characters of the invocation digest the name carries.

Named for the character count it produces, which is this project's
convention (`workspace_manager`'s `REPO_KEY_HEX_CHARS` says so in as many
words).

## `pub const MAX_COMPONENT_LEN: usize = 64;`

The longest a single name component may be.

A run id and an incarnation are 26-character ULIDs and a repo key is 16 hex
characters, so this is slack rather than a constraint on anything the engine
produces — it exists so a hostile value cannot push the whole name past what
a container runtime accepts.

## `pub const MAX_NAME_LEN: usize = 200;`

The longest whole name.

Docker's own limit is far higher; the engine's own longest name is
`upstroke`(6) + 4 separators + 16 + 26 + 26 + 16 = 94.

## `pub const LABEL_PRIVATE_ROOT: &str = "upstroke.private_root";`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The five labels
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub const LABEL_PRIVATE_ROOT: &str = "upstroke.private_root";`

`upstroke.private_root` — the canonical path of `<R>`. Discovery is `docker
ps` by this label.

## `pub const LABEL_RUN: &str = "upstroke.run";`

`upstroke.run` — the owner run id.

## `pub const LABEL_RUN_DIR: &str = "upstroke.run_dir";`

`upstroke.run_dir` — the owner's **public** run directory.

## `pub const LABEL_INCARNATION: &str = "upstroke.incarnation";`

`upstroke.incarnation` — the owning coordinator incarnation.

## `pub const LABEL_INVOCATION: &str = "upstroke.invocation";`

`upstroke.invocation` — the rendered [`InvocationId`], in full.

## `pub const LABELS: &[&str] = &[`

The five labels, in the packet's order.

Written out rather than derived from the map a container carries, so a
label dropped from the map is a disagreement with this list rather than a
shorter map nobody compares to anything.

## `const LABEL_UNRESERVED: &[u8] = b"/:.-_";`

The bytes [`path_label`] passes through unescaped.

`/` is here because it is a path separator on both platforms and keeping it
literal is what makes a label readable; `:` because a Windows drive letter
is not ambiguous with anything. Nothing else structural survives: `%` is the
escape and must itself escape, and `,`, `=` and the line terminators are the
bytes that would end a `docker --filter label=…` argument or start another
one, so a root carrying them cannot widen a filter.

## `const HEX: &[u8; 16] = b"0123456789ABCDEF";`

The hex digits an escape is written with, and the only ones
[`decode_path_label`] accepts.

## `pub fn path_label(path: &Path) -> String {`

A path as a label value: percent-encoded, injective, and ASCII.

**Injective, and two things in this module have to be.** [`ContainerName`]
was designed for injectivity — its components are `[0-9A-Za-z_]` only, so
the parse on `-` is unambiguous — because `crash_reconstruction` says
"different private roots are **disjoint worlds**". A label is the other half
of that sentence: `upstroke.private_root` is the value
`docker ps --filter label=upstroke.private_root=…` selects on, so two distinct
roots that render to one label are one world, and a census authorized for
either queries — and reclaims — the containers of the other.

**`upstroke.run_dir` is the same function for a sharper reason.** It is the
owner's public run directory, and arm (ii) of the liveness rule *probes that
directory's `run.lock`*: "free -> dead owner -> reclaim; held -> live owner
-> never touched". A rendering that maps two directories onto one string
sends the probe to a **different, real** directory, finds no lock there, and
classifies a **live** owner as dead — which kills a running coordinator's
container. `PR6-RECOV-001` is that entry.

The rendering that shipped was `to_string_lossy().replace('\\', "/")`, which
collides two ways. `<R>/a\b` and `<R>/a/b` are **different directories on
Unix**, where a backslash is an ordinary filename byte, and they rendered to
one label; and `to_string_lossy` maps every ill-formed byte sequence to
`U+FFFD`, so two distinct non-UTF-8 roots rendered to one label as well.
Substituting one ambiguity for another — rewriting `:` as well, say — keeps
every existing fixture green, which is why the property asserted is a
**colliding pair**, not a round trip.

So: percent-encode the path's own bytes. Every byte outside
[`LABEL_UNRESERVED`] and the ASCII alphanumerics becomes `%XX`, upper-case
hex, which is injective because `%` is itself escaped and every escape is a
fixed three bytes. [`decode_path_label`] is the inverse and exists: an
encoding the census cannot undo would be injective and useless, because the
probe needs the *path* back.

**The one byte that is platform-shaped is `\`, and it is not an exception to
injectivity.** On Windows `\` and `/` are both path separators and `<R>\a`
and `<R>/a` name the same directory, so rendering `\` as `/` maps *equal*
roots to one label — canonicalization, which injectivity over paths asks
for. On Unix `\` names a different directory and is escaped like any other
byte. The `cfg` and this sentence are asserted against each other by
`census::tests::the_private_root_label_is_injective_over_hostile_roots`.

## `pub fn private_root_label(private_root: &Path) -> String {`

The value of the `upstroke.private_root` label for a root.

A name for one use of [`path_label`], kept because the private root is the
value a `docker ps --filter` argument is built from and the call sites read
better for saying so.

## `pub fn decode_path_label(value: &str) -> Result<PathBuf, UpstrokeError> {`

[`path_label`]'s inverse: the path a label value was encoded from.

**Fail-closed, and deliberately strict.** A value this function cannot
decode is not a value any funnel wrote, and the census's answer to evidence
it cannot read is to refuse and block admission — never to guess a path and
then probe a lock there. `%` followed by anything but two upper-case hex
digits is the only malformed shape [`path_label`] cannot produce, so it is
the only one refused.

On Unix an `OsStr` is bytes and the decode is exact. On Windows an `OsStr`
is WTF-8 and only its UTF-8 subset can be rebuilt safely — the alternative
is `OsStr::from_encoded_bytes_unchecked`, whose contract a hostile label
value cannot be trusted to meet. A Windows path outside UTF-8 is an unpaired
surrogate in a file name; refusing it is the fail-closed side of that trade
and is stated here rather than discovered.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when `value` carries a malformed escape, or when
the decoded bytes are not a path this platform can name.

## `pub fn decode_path_label(value: &str) -> Result<PathBuf, Up…` › `bytes.push(((high << 4) | low) as u8);`

`as u8` cannot truncate: both indices are positions in a 16-byte
table, so the value is `0..=255` by construction.

## `pub struct ContainerIntent {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The record
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub struct ContainerIntent {`

`<R>/containers/<name>.intent` — the six fields, in the packet's order.

`deny_unknown_fields` for the same reason [`crate::rundir::CreatingMarker`]
carries it: a record that grew a seventh field somewhere else is a record
this process did not write, and reading it as if it had is how one engine
adopts another's ownership evidence.

## `pub struct ContainerIntent` › `pub run_id: String,`

Owner run id.

## `pub struct ContainerIntent` › `pub run_dir: String,`

Run directory — the **public** path, canonical, as a [`path_label`].

**Encoded, and the record and the label carry one spelling.** The
`upstroke.run_dir` label is this field verbatim, so a second rendering
would be a second thing to keep in step; and the census reaches the
owner's `run.lock` through [`Self::run_dir_path`], which is
[`decode_path_label`] and the rooted check in one place. Build the
record with [`Self::new`] rather than filling this in by hand — a raw
path whose bytes are all unreserved is its own encoding and survives
either way, but one carrying a `%` does not.

## `pub struct ContainerIntent` › `pub incarnation: String,`

Coordinator incarnation id: a per-process ULID, never read from a lock
file.

## `pub struct ContainerIntent` › `pub repo_key: String,`

Repo key.

## `pub struct ContainerIntent` › `pub invocation: String,`

The rendered [`InvocationId`], in full. The name carries a 16-character
digest of it; this field carries the value, so ownership evidence is
exact rather than collision-resistant.

## `pub struct ContainerIntent` › `pub runner_policy_sha256: String,`

`runner_policy_sha256` — the digest of the run's `RunnerPolicy`, so
"the census report names each reclaimed container's boundary from its
`runner_policy_sha256`" can be answered from the record alone.

## `impl ContainerIntent` › `pub fn new(`

The six fields, with the run directory encoded on the way in.

The one construction site production code uses, so "the record's run
directory is a [`path_label`]" is true by construction rather than by
every caller remembering.

## `impl ContainerIntent` › `pub fn run_dir_path(&self) -> Result<PathBuf, UpstrokeError> {`

The owner's public run directory, decoded and checked.

### Errors

As [`owner_run_dir`].

## `impl ContainerIntent` › `pub fn labels(&self, private_root: &Path) -> BTreeMap<String, String> {`

The five labels this intent's container carries, given the private root
its record lives under.

The labels are derived from the record rather than passed beside it, so
a container whose labels and whose intent disagree is not constructible
through this API — `labeled_orphan_without_intent_reclaimed` is about a
container with **no** record, which is a different thing.

`upstroke.private_root` is the one label with no field of its own: the
record's *location* is inside `<R>`, so the root is what the census
already knows when it reads one.

## `pub fn owner_run_dir(value: &str, source: &str) -> Result<PathBuf, UpstrokeError> {`

The owner's public run directory, from a record field or a label value.

**The census probes `<run_dir>/run.lock` and acts on the answer**, so this
is the function that decides which lock the question "is that owner alive?"
is asked about. Two shapes must never reach it as a path:

* the **empty** value, which joins to `run.lock` — a path relative to
  whatever directory this process happens to be in, where there is no lock,
  so a live owner reads as dead and its running container is killed
  (`PR6-CORRECTNESS-016`);
* any other **relative** value, for the same reason with more steps.

The predicate is [`Path::has_root`] and not `is_absolute`, deliberately. On
Windows `is_absolute` additionally requires a prefix, so `/srv/…` — the
shape every Unix-written record carries and every cross-platform fixture
uses — is *not* absolute there, and the check would refuse on one platform
what it accepts on the other. `has_root` is the property that actually
matters here: a rooted path does not depend on the process's working
directory. A drive-relative `C:dir` has no root and is refused.

Refusing is what `expected_failures_refusals[8]` asks for — "an unreclaimable
labeled container blocks admission" — and it is the fail-closed side: the
alternative to refusing unownable evidence is probing *something*, and every
wrong probe answers "free", which reclaims.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when `value` does not decode, is empty, or is not
rooted.

## `pub fn owner_run_dir(value: &str, source: &str) -> Result<P…` › `let path = decode_path_label(value).map_err(|error| UpstrokeError::Refused {`

Wrapped, not propagated: a census refusal that did not name the field
would leave an operator reading a decoder's complaint with no way to know
which piece of evidence carried it.

## `pub struct IntentWritten {`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The capability: proof that a container's intent record is published
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub struct IntentWritten {`

Evidence that `<R>/containers/<name>.intent` exists and is a
[`ContainerIntent`].

`expected_failures_refusals[6]`: "container start without an intent is
**impossible by construction**". `super::create_container` and
`super::start_container` take one of these by reference, so reaching
`Container.Create` or `Container.Start` without the record is not a thing a
caller can express.

**The proof is a filesystem observation, not a private field**, and that is
forced rather than chosen: `runner::container::exec`, `::census` and every
other lane module is a *descendant* of `runner::container`, and Rust makes
an ancestor's private items visible to its descendants — so a token minted
only inside `container.rs` would be forgeable from `exec.rs` by writing the
struct literal. Grounding the proof in `<R>/containers` closes that: the
only way to obtain one is to have the record on disk, which is the property
the clause is about. It is the tree's own "ground truth is the diff, not the
transcript" applied to ownership evidence.

The fields are private so the pair (name, path) cannot be recombined — a
proof for container A cannot be relabelled as a proof for container B.

## `impl IntentWritten` › `pub fn certify(private_root: &Path, name: &ContainerName) -> Result<Self, UpstrokeError> {`

Read `<R>/containers/<name>.intent` back and certify it.

The **only** constructor. `super::write_intent` calls it after
publishing, which is what makes its return value a proof rather than a
path; a census or a reclaimer that already holds a record calls it
directly. Either way the record was on disk when the proof was made.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Io`] when the record is absent or unreadable —
`ErrorKind::NotFound` is the "no intent" case and is a refusal, not an
absence to tolerate — and [`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when the bytes are
not a [`ContainerIntent`].

## `impl IntentWritten` › `pub const fn name(&self) -> &ContainerName {`

The container this record owns.

## `impl IntentWritten` › `pub fn path(&self) -> &Path {`

Where the record is.

## `impl IntentWritten` › `pub const fn record(&self) -> &ContainerIntent {`

The six fields, as they were read back.

## `pub struct ContainerName(String);`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The name
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `pub struct ContainerName(String);`

`upstroke-<repo_key>-<run_id>-<incarnation>-<invocation-hash>`.

**Injective by construction.** No component may contain
[`NAME_SEPARATOR`], so a rendered name splits into exactly five fields and
two distinct tuples differ in some field and therefore in the rendering.
[`ContainerName::parse`] is the inverse and refuses anything else.

The **incarnation** component is the one carrying the packet's stated
purpose: "deterministic `InvocationId`s never collide across incarnations
and no earlier ownership evidence is overwritten". A probe identity repeats
across incarnations by construction (`InvocationId::Probe`'s own doc says
so), so without that component a resuming incarnation would write its intent
over the dead one's — destroying the evidence the census needs.

## `pub struct ContainerNameParts {`

A name taken back apart.

## `impl ContainerName` › `pub fn new(`

Build the name from its four components.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when a component is empty, carries a character
outside `[0-9A-Za-z_]`, is longer than [`MAX_COMPONENT_LEN`], or when
the whole name would exceed [`MAX_NAME_LEN`].

## `impl ContainerName` › `pub fn from_parts(`

Build the name from four already-rendered components.

Separate from [`Self::new`] so a test can construct a name whose
invocation component is *not* the hash of any invocation — which is what
makes the parse's injectivity testable over the whole component domain
rather than over the digests one function happens to produce.

### Errors

As [`Self::new`].

## `impl ContainerName` › `pub fn as_str(&self) -> &str {`

The name as the runtime sees it.

## `impl ContainerName` › `pub fn intent_file_name(&self) -> String {`

The file name of this container's intent record.

## `impl ContainerName` › `pub fn intent_path(&self, private_root: &Path) -> PathBuf {`

`<R>/containers/<name>.intent`.

## `impl ContainerName` › `pub fn parse(value: &str) -> Result<ContainerNameParts, UpstrokeError> {`

Take a rendered name apart.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when `value` is not `upstroke-` followed by
exactly four separator-free components.

## `impl ContainerName` › `pub fn rebuild(value: &str) -> Result<Self, UpstrokeError> {`

Rebuild a name from a rendered value, refusing one no funnel could have
written.

### Errors

As [`Self::parse`] and [`Self::from_parts`].

## `impl ContainerName` › `pub fn from_intent_file_name(file_name: &str) -> Result<Option<Self>, UpstrokeError> {`

The name of the container whose intent record this file name belongs to,
or `None`.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] when the stem is not a well-formed name.

## `pub fn containers_dir(private_root: &Path) -> PathBuf {`

`<R>/containers`.

## `pub fn invocation_hash(invocation: &InvocationId) -> String {`

`hex16(sha256(domain || 0x00 || rendered invocation id))`.

A digest and not the value itself, because the packet says
`<invocation-hash>`: a rendered [`InvocationId`] is up to
[`crate::runner::invocation::MAX_LEN`] bytes and carries `.` separators,
and the name already has four components. The **record** carries the
invocation in full, so ownership evidence stays exact — a 64-bit digest is
collision-resistant, not injective, and the difference matters for evidence
even though it does not matter for a name.

## `fn validate_component(what: &str, value: &str) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {`

Refuse a component that would make the name ambiguous or unusable.

The charset excludes [`NAME_SEPARATOR`] — which is what
[`ContainerName::parse`]'s injectivity rests on — and `.`, which is the
separator inside a rendered [`InvocationId`] and the boundary of the
`.intent` suffix.
