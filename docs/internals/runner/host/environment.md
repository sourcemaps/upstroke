# `src/runner/host/environment.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/runner/host/environment.rs`](../../../../src/runner/host/environment.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does; this file is the whole of its prose, moved out of
the source verbatim. Each section is headed by the line of code the comment sat above, spelled
as it is in the source, so the heading is the grep string that finds the code.

## Module

`host-v1`'s environment contract: the platform's name rule, and the
composition of base, reserved values and overlay (DESIGN.md:258-264).

The vocabulary this composes over -- `RESERVED_ALWAYS`,
`CREDENTIAL_LOCATIONS`, [`reserved_keys`] and [`supplies_credentials`] --
stays in the parent, which is "the one list" `runner::container::env` reads.
What lives here is the rule that decides *which* variables a request gets
and in what order, and it performs no effect: the base is handed in.

## `#![forbid(`

**This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
level is scoped by the module tree and not by the file, so an out-of-line
child of `src/runner/host.rs` would otherwise inherit that file's inner
`#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
-- `PR6-LANEF-004`, and the mistake two W1 pull requests each made
independently. Nothing here reaches a governed primitive, so all three are
DENIED rather than allowed, and this module takes no `effects/allowlist.toml`
row: an allowance is what that file records, and this module takes none.
`runner::container::tests::every_child_module_of_the_container_funnel_states_\
its_own_lint_level` already walks `src/runner/host/`, so this file was graded
against all three from its first commit.

## `pub enum KeyCase {`

How the platform compares environment variable names.

A type rather than a `cfg!` at each comparison. `cfg!(windows)` is false on
a Linux developer box and on the Linux CI cell, so a rule written as a
`cfg!` is a rule whose Windows arm no test on those machines can reach —
both sides of the pin move together. [`Self::ALL`] is what the grids run
over; [`Self::current`] is what production selects. The same shape
[`crate::topology::effects::Host`] uses, for the same reason.

## `pub enum KeyCase` › `Sensitive,`

Unix: `Path` and `PATH` are two variables.

## `pub enum KeyCase` › `Insensitive,`

Windows: `Path` and `PATH` are one variable, and a child that received
both would receive whichever the block happened to list last.

## `impl KeyCase` › `pub const ALL: &'static [Self] = &[Self::Sensitive, Self::Insensitive];`

Both rules. Every grid runs over this, not over [`Self::current`].

## `impl KeyCase` › `pub const fn current() -> Self {`

The rule this machine's process environment obeys.

## `impl KeyCase` › `pub fn same_key(self, left: &OsStr, right: &OsStr) -> bool {`

Whether these two names are the same variable under this rule.

## `pub enum ObjectGraph {`

Which object graph the Git children of a composed environment read, and
the one thing about it a conductor gets to choose.

`Recorded` is the default and the schema-4 rule: the objects the
repository holds, never the objects `refs/replace/*` points at them
(`design/15`, "What an exact snapshot is exact against"). It is what
`compose` writes [`NO_REPLACEMENT_OBJECTS`](../../../../src/workspace_manager.rs)
for.

`AsReplaced` is the schema-1..3 exemption, and it exists because a
consumer must read what its own producer wrote. The v0.1 workspace
(`src/workspace.rs`) sets no such pair on its Git children and is frozen
by `effects/allowlist.toml`'s `[[legacy]]` row — `invariants_preserved[1]`,
"this module's behaviour untouched" — so its checkout of a commit whose
recorded tree carries a replacement materialises the *replacing* tree.
Composing the pair for a gate over that checkout put the two on different
graphs and failed `git diff --exit-code HEAD` on a workspace the engine
itself had just written (measured on git 2.43, PR #271 round 1's
regression finding). So each path is internally consistent instead: the
v0.1 conductor installs `AsReplaced` at `engine::run` and
`engine::resume`, and the schema-4 path, whose producer removes
replacements at both ends, keeps `Recorded`. That the v0.1 path reads
replacements at all is `LEGACY-WORKSPACE-READS-REPLACEMENT-OBJECTS`,
deferred behind that freeze and unchanged by this.

It is a field of the environment rather than of the request because it is
a property of the *conductor* — one schema per run, chosen once where the
runner is built — and because defaulting it here makes the isolated
reading the one a new spawn site gets without asking.

## `pub struct HostEnvironment {`

`host-v1`'s environment contract.

Holds its base explicitly so a test can compose against a base it wrote
rather than against whatever variables happen to be set on the machine
running the suite.

## `impl HostEnvironment` › `pub fn from_process() -> Self {`

The Upstroke process environment, under this platform's name rule.

## `impl HostEnvironment` › `pub fn with_base(base: Vec<(OsString, OsString)>, case: KeyCase) -> Self {`

An explicit base, for grids that must cover both name rules.

## `impl HostEnvironment` › `pub const fn reading(mut self, objects: ObjectGraph) -> Self {`

The object graph this environment's children read. Owned by whoever
builds the runner, never by an adapter or an overlay.

## `impl HostEnvironment` › `pub const fn objects(&self) -> ObjectGraph {`

Which graph is in force, so a witness can assert what a conductor
installed rather than infer it from a composed vector.

## `impl HostEnvironment` › `pub fn base(&self) -> &[(OsString, OsString)] {`

The base this runner composes from.

## `impl HostEnvironment` › `pub const fn case(&self) -> KeyCase {`

The name rule in force.

## `impl HostEnvironment` › `pub fn reserved_values(`

The reserved values the runner supplies for this request.

A reserved key the base does not carry is **not** supplied: setting an
absent variable to the empty string is a different environment from not
setting it, and several CLIs read "set but empty" as an instruction.

DESIGN.md:259-262 — "the host runner starts from the Upstroke environment
and the container runner from the image environment; **each** supplies
role-scoped `HOME`, `PATH`, and credential locations" — resolved for
`host-v1` as follows, and the split is deliberate:

* **credential locations are role-scoped**, by
  [`supplies_credentials`]. A gate is repository-controlled code and the
  shell probe is a shell; neither runs an agent CLI, so neither is told
  where an agent's credentials live, whatever agent the request happens
  to name. This is the sentence's own word "role-scoped" doing work.
* **`HOME`, `PATH` and `USERPROFILE` are supplied to every role at the
  host boundary's own value.** That is a boundary, and "one machine,
  one user" is a rationale rather than a basis for it, so it is drawn
  from live passages — three of them, each forbidding a different part
  of a per-role value:

  1. DESIGN.md:263 — "Probe and execution compose the **same** base,
     mounts, reserved values, and overlay, so pre-flight certifies the
     environment that will actually spend." `probe(<agent>)`,
     `implement` and `review` are the probe and the execution that
     sentence pairs; a `HOME` differing across them would make
     pre-flight certify an environment the attempt never runs in.
  2. `design/26_design_merge_queue_protocol.md:388-389` (§26) —
     "gate-shell/program availability is checked inside the same
     boundary." The shell probe certifies the shell a gate will run; a
     `PATH` differing between `probe(shell)` and `gate` would certify a
     different program from the one that runs.
  3. The same section, :398 — "Host runner behavior remains
     available and honestly provides **no OS boundary** around gate
     code." Handing gate code a different `HOME` on this host would
     assert an isolation the host does not have: repository-controlled
     code reads the real home directory by absolute path either way.
     What the host *can* honestly do is not disclose a location it
     would otherwise hand over, and that is [`supplies_credentials`].

  The value comes from the base rather than from anything this runner
  invents, because the same section says where the base is (:378-379):
  "**The host base starts from the Upstroke process environment**, while
  the container base starts from the image environment." A process
  environment carries one value per key under [`KeyCase`] — so one
  value is what a correct `host-v1` *produces*, not a narrowing this
  slice chose. The container runner differs not because its `HOME`
  string differs per role but because each role's container is its own
  filesystem; PR4's `production_effect` is "same behavior plus stronger
  Windows crash containment", and no passage describes a per-role home
  directory on the host for it to grow into.

  Asserted from those passages, not commented, by
  `the_reserved_values_every_role_gets_are_the_host_boundarys_own` — so
  a `host-v1` that ever does scope `HOME` has to change a passage
  first, rather than a count.

A reserved key the base does not carry is **not** supplied: setting an
absent variable to the empty string is a different environment from not
setting it, and several CLIs read "set but empty" as an instruction.

## `impl HostEnvironment` › `pub fn compose(`

Base, then reserved values, then overlay — DESIGN.md:263's own order
("the same base, mounts, reserved values, and overlay").

The base's own copies of the **reserved** keys are dropped before the
runner supplies them, and that is what makes "role-scoped" a property
of the child's environment rather than of a vector nothing reads.
Cloning the base and then upserting would leave every credential
location the Upstroke process happens to carry in a gate's environment —
a gate is repository-controlled code, and `CODEX_HOME` reaching it is
exactly the thing [`supplies_credentials`] exists to prevent. It would
also make this step *output-equivalent to deleting it*, because
[`Self::reserved_values`] reads the values back out of the same base.
So the reserved keys arrive from one place — this function's supply
step, which is role-scoped — or not at all.

Then [`NO_REPLACEMENT_OBJECTS`](../../../../src/workspace_manager.rs), **after**
the overlay and not before it, and under [`ObjectGraph::Recorded`] — every
environment but the v0.1 conductor's, whose own producer reads the replaced
graph and whose section above says why. `HostRunner::run` clears the ambient environment
and installs exactly what this returns, so a pair that is not composed here
reaches no child: a gate or a reviewer inside an exact snapshot would read
whatever `git replace` points at the judged objects, and measured on git 2.43 it
did — `git show HEAD:f` returned the replacement and `git status --porcelain`
called an untouched snapshot modified. `design/15`'s "What an exact snapshot is
exact against" is the product sentence; the pair is one constant named at each
of the four boundaries that starts a child which can run Git over a snapshot
this engine produced.

It is **asserted, not reserved**, and the two are different things. The reserved
keys are values this boundary reads *from its host* and re-supplies role-scoped,
which is why they are stripped from the base first and why `preflight` refuses
an overlay that restates one — a gate permitted to set `PATH` is a hijack. This
one is a constant the runner states; there is nothing in the base to re-supply,
an overlay restating it is not a hijack but a no-op, and refusing it would add a
failure mode without adding a guarantee. The ordering is what supplies the
guarantee: last write wins, and this is the last write. Git 2.43 reads the
*presence* of the variable rather than its value (measured: `=0` and `=false`
both disable replacement as `=1` does), so the value `1` is correct under either
reading and an overlay could not re-enable the mechanism even if it outranked
this step — the ordering is what makes that true of a future Git that does read
the value.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] naming the key when the overlay names a
reserved one. That is the contract's `expected_failures_refusals[0]`,
"reserved env conflict -> pre-flight error", and it is refused by
**key**: `invariants_introduced[0]` says "reserved keys refused
pre-flight", and an overlay permitted to restate `PATH` today because
the value happens to match is an overlay that breaks silently the day
the runner's value changes.

## `impl HostEnvironment` › `pub fn preflight(&self, overlay: &[(String, String)]) -> Result<(), UpstrokeError> {`

The reserved-key refusal on its own, so a caller can certify an overlay
without building an environment.

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`] naming the offending key and the reserved key
it collides with.
