# `src/runner/host/probe.rs`

Extended notes for [`src/runner/host/probe.rs`](../../../../src/runner/host/probe.rs).

The code is the authority for what it does; this file is the whole of its prose, moved out of
the source verbatim. Each section is headed by the line of code the comment sat above, spelled
as it is in the source, so the heading is the grep string that finds the code.

## Module

The `RunnerPreflight` shell probe: the command it runs, how long it may
take, and its execution through a [`Runner`].

INV-23's non-slotted half. What the probe *means* is the same for both
runners -- PR6's container runner executes the identical request inside the
recorded image -- so nothing here is host-specific and nothing here performs
an effect: the spawn belongs to whichever `Runner` the caller passes, which
for `host-v1` is the parent module's `HostRunner::run`.

The request *constructor* stays in the parent and is deliberately not here.
`runner::contract::tests::every_production_runner_request_is_built_by_its_roles_builder`
and `runner::contract::tests::a_command_is_assembled_in_one_production_place_per_role`
pin `RunnerRequest`'s and `ShellKind::spec`'s one production construction
site per role by file, and `src/runner/host.rs` is the pinned file -- the
same kind of pin that keeps `Contained`'s mint and the reserved-key
vocabulary in the parent. Construction is pinned; execution is not.

## `#![forbid(`

**This child states its own lint level and inherits nothing.** A Rust lint
level is scoped by the module tree and not by the file, so an out-of-line
child of `src/runner/host.rs` would otherwise inherit that file's inner
`#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, disallowed_types, disallowed_macros)]`
(its allow of all three when this was written; since 2026-09-26 it allows
`clippy::disallowed_types` alone and forbids the other two in production)
-- `PR6-LANEF-004`, and the mistake two W1 pull requests each made
independently. Nothing here reaches a governed primitive, so all three are
DENIED rather than allowed, and this module takes no `effects/allowlist.toml`
row: an allowance is what that file records, and this module takes none.
`runner::container::tests::every_child_module_of_the_container_funnel_states_\
its_own_lint_level` already walks `src/runner/host/`, so this file was graded
against all three from its first commit.

## `pub const SHELL_PROBE_COMMAND: &str = "exit 0";`

The command the `RunnerPreflight` shell probe runs.

`decisions.sequential_substrate.runner`: "the RunnerPreflight shell probe
(the recorded shell executing `exit 0` through the Runner …)". Not `true`,
not `--version`: `exit 0` is a builtin of every shell
[`ShellKind`] names, so the probe tests the shell and not a program that
happens to be beside it.

## `pub const SHELL_PROBE_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(10);`

How long the shell probe may take.

A shell that has not run `exit 0` in ten seconds is unavailable for
pre-flight's purposes whatever it is doing.

## `pub fn run_shell_probe(`

Execute the shell probe through `runner`.

The packet's own finding `F-43` / `V14-VERIFY-004` is why this exists:
availability cannot be established by inspection, only by a spawn.
`gates::shell_available` is a PATH check and stays one — it answers
"is there a file with that name", which is a different question from "does
this shell run a command".

### Errors

[`UpstrokeError::Refused`]. The contract's `expected_failures_refusals[3]`:
"a failing shell probe -> returned pre-flight error to the caller
(TopologyRun classifies it: creator error before P5b on a fresh run;
refusal before any recovery event on resume)". Classification is the
caller's; this returns the error.

## `if output.output_limited {`

A probe whose tree was terminated for exceeding the bounded capture
allowance did not run `exit 0` to completion, whatever code came back.
`output_limited` means the supervisor killed the owned process tree
(`proc.rs`: "the child exceeded the bounded stdout or stderr capture
allowance and its owned process tree was terminated"), and the limit can
be observed during the final drain of a child that has *already exited
0* — so this is checked on its own rather than through the exit code. A
shell that printed 16 MiB in answer to `exit 0` is not the shell this
pre-flight is certifying either way.
