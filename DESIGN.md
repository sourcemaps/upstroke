# upstroke — Design Document v2.1

> **Name:** `upstroke` — the conductor's preparatory lift: the rising beat that cues the performers and sounds no note itself, which is exactly the engine's relation to the agents it dispatches. Verified free on crates.io and npm (2026-08-08, live API check). Known adjacent collision: AnthusAI/Upstroke, an alpha Lua DSL for agent orchestration (~3★) — assessed as tolerable, but the decision is deliberate: we differentiate hard rather than share ground by accident. **Action on repo creation: publish a placeholder crate immediately.**

**Status:** v2 — consolidates the original architecture, the two-phase lifecycle, the interaction model, the capacity engine, and two rounds of research whose companion reports are maintained in the strategy record outside this repository, plus the v2.1 late-binding refinement: connect your plans; tiers bind to concrete models and pools at attempt time.
**Language:** Rust · **License:** Apache-2.0, relicensed from AGPL-3.0-only on 2026-09-01 · **Form factor:** single static binary, Windows first-class

This file is the index. The design lives in `design/`, one numbered section per
file, and **it is the only living authority for product design.** Section
numbers are the API: code, reviews, and the standards cite `DESIGN.md §N`, so a
number is never reassigned. New sections append; a retired section keeps its
number and says so. When a decision changes the design, the section changes in
the same pull request — there is no separate record to keep in step.

Read §4 in full before touching the engine, the event log, or anything that
handles capacity or questions. §21 is the build order, and it is deliberate.

## Line citations

Comments in `src/` cite the pre-split document by line, as `DESIGN.md:<line>`.
Those lines refer to the single-file `DESIGN.md` as it stood at master
`cfec136` on 2026-09-03, the last commit before the split; the file is
unchanged in that history. This table resolves a line to its section, which is
where the sentence now lives, unchanged. New citations use `§N`.

| Lines | § | Lines | § | Lines | § |

| 1–9 | preamble (this file) | 268–287 | 9 | 550–567 | 18 |

## Retired records

Until 2026-09-03 the repository also carried `decisions/` (dated decision
records), `proposals/` (design proposals and their council critiques) and
`acceptance/` (the v0.1 acceptance run book and write-ups). They were retired
so that the design is the one place a rule lives; every conclusion they reached
that still binds is in the sections above. The full texts remain in the
repository history before that date and in the private companion repository.
Comments in `src/`, `effects/allowlist.toml` and `upstroke.toml` still cite
some records by path; this table says where each one's substance now lives.

| Record | Substance now in |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-11 design council | §21 (learned routing parked; the council is manual, ≤3 family seats) |
| 2026-08-11 self-hosting v0.2 | §21 (v0.2 development runs through upstroke) |
| 2026-08-11 gate config across a resume | §15 (gates are taken from the record, warning on drift) |
| 2026-08-11 Codex reasoning effort | §10, §16, §21 (effort is a routing axis, stated on every attempt) |
| 2026-08-11 export schema | §25 |
| 2026-08-12 merge queue and execution topology | §26 (the verdict and the durable protocol, verbatim), summarised in §7, §14, §15 |
| 2026-08-17 review effort and fan-out | `MAINTAINING.md` (one frontier pass at `max`; `ultra` is delegation, not depth) |
| 2026-08-20 automated review gate; 2026-08-20 review invalidation scope; 2026-08-21 stacked slice PRs; 2026-08-23 retire App attestation; 2026-08-25 checkpoint merges; 2026-08-31 panel seats; 2026-09-01 review effort re-scoped; 2026-09-01 clean base merge keeps review | `MAINTAINING.md` (the whole review and merge lifecycle, restated in its current form; the workflow trigger contract under Repository rules) |
| 2026-08-22 strategy record private; 2026-08-27 proposals private; 2026-09-01 proposals relocated; 2026-09-01 infra private | This section (strategy, proposals and operator tooling live in the private companion repository) |
| 2026-08-24 PR3-layer freeze charter; 2026-08-31 G2 checkpoint promotion; 2026-08-31 inertness premise behavioural | §21 (the G2 pass ran; the schema-4 machinery is on master, inert by default) |
| 2026-08-25 `CommandSpec.program` stays `String` | §8 (the field carries a bare CLI name; `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §8 governs it the moment a path-valued input exists) |
| 2026-08-26 durable retry feedback | §15 (`FailureRecord.detail` carries the retry brief onto the durable record) |
| 2026-08-30 readiness lint placement | `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §2 (lints) and §12 (a per-site `#[expect]` recorded in `effects/allowlist.toml` may stand where a module-level allow did) |
| 2026-08-30 test scratch-tree ownership | §15 (run-directory deletion authority is token-carried: `rundir::PrivateHalfProof` and the `cfg(test)`-only scratch-tree token) |
| 2026-09-01 self-hosted Windows test leg | `MAINTAINING.md` step 3 and `ci.yml` (`test-windows` runs the Windows suite on an ephemeral self-hosted runner for a pull request or push and, since 2026-09-16, on `windows-latest` for a merge-queue entry; the Windows Clippy, build-witness and MSRV legs stay on GitHub's runner) |
| 2026-09-01 relicense to Apache-2.0 | `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (the CLA), `MAINTAINING.md` (the archive-contents release gate) |
| The thirteen proposals | Ten were already stubs; the G2 pass plan is discharged (§21), and the v0.5 portfolio proposal and its critique are v0.5 material, out of the engine's contract |
| The acceptance run book and write-ups | §21 (the v0.1 definition of done and the date it was met) |
