## Failure sequence

**The site is `~/bin/upstroke-build`, which is not in this repository**, so this row carries no `location:` — the same shape as `PR5D-TOOLBOX-DISCARDS-CLIPPY-OUTPUT`, whose subject is the same file, and `PR262-WIDENED-RESERVATION-NEVER-REACHES-THE-SCHEDULER`. It is filed here because this directory is what the sweep's owner reads.

`upstroke-build` binds `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to a slot from a bounded pool, and **the slot is chosen by lock availability, never by worktree**: `~/bin/upstroke-build:114-139` walks `slot1..slotN`, takes the first whose lock `flock -n` succeeds on, and `exec env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$d" … "$@"` (`:136`). `$PWD` is never consulted. That is deliberate and it is the point of the wrapper — a bounded set of repeating target paths is what makes sccache hit, and the header's own measurement puts one-target-dir-per-worktree at 0/55 hits against 54/55 (`:8-20`). The consequence is not the point: **many worktrees share one target directory, and everything in it that is not source-path keyed belongs to whichever worktree built there last.**

So a run can be handed the previous occupant's build. Its compile is skipped, cargo prints no `Compiling` or `Checking` line naming the crate path, and it exits 0. **Measured at 160 tests' difference on byte-identical source**; the sweep's standing rules carry that measurement and the rule derived from it — a green `upstroke-build` run is not evidence unless it names its own crate path (`~/findings-sweep/BRIEF-PREAMBLE.md`).

Executed on the build box, 2026-09-10, at `e8fcbdd8`:

```text
the slot ignores the worktree — three checkouts, one after another:
  /srv/worktrees/fsweep-triage   ->  CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/mnt/ramtarget/slot1
  /srv/worktrees/fsweep-251      ->  CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/mnt/ramtarget/slot1
  /srv/worktrees/fsweep-232      ->  CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/mnt/ramtarget/slot1

what the pool holds at rest — distinct /srv/worktrees roots named by each slot's
.d files, and the worktree named by that slot's top-level debug/libupstroke.d:
  slot1    5   <no libupstroke.d>          (this session cleaned the crate here)
  slot2    4   <no libupstroke.d>
  slot3   10   /srv/worktrees/sweep-fixture
  slot4    3   /srv/worktrees/topo-effects-parent
  slot5    9   /srv/worktrees/pr7-b
  slot6    6   /srv/worktrees/pr7-b
  slot7    6   /srv/worktrees/pr7-b
  slot8    5   <no libupstroke.d>
```

Five of the eight slots hold a top-level `debug/libupstroke.rlib` built from a **named other worktree**, and every slot's dependency files name between three and ten distinct checkouts. The per-crate outputs under `debug/deps/` are hash-keyed and coexist; the top-level names — `debug/libupstroke.rlib`, `debug/upstroke`, and the probe binaries beside them — are not. **What this shows is that slots are shared between worktrees, and no more than that**: the top-level artifact's dependency file says which source tree last wrote *that* artifact, which is not the test executable any run executed.

**The 160-test discrepancy is an unexplained observation, and it stays one in this row.** It establishes that two runs over byte-identical source reported different test counts. It does **not** establish which cargo decision produced that: whether a warm slot's fingerprints let cargo consider the current source fresh, whether the count came from a test binary the current source never produced, or something else again. Reproducing the number was not attempted here, and nothing below should be read as having diagnosed it — the slot-sharing measurement above is evidence that slots are shared, which is a precondition for the discrepancy and not a mechanism for it.

**The consequence is about evidence, not only about builds.** Every "gates green" claim made on this box is unattributable unless the run's own output named its crate path — including claims already recorded in merged pull request bodies. This pull request's gate table shows the shape: of three consecutive full-suite runs, run 2 returned rc=0 with **no crate-path line and was discarded as evidence for exactly that reason**, while runs 1 and 3 carried `Compiling upstroke v0.1.0 (/srv/worktrees/fsweep-triage)`.

## What the change that takes this up should do

Owner, as the ledger records it: the project owner — the build box's tooling, not the tree. `~/bin/upstroke-build` is outside this repository, so **no pull request here can close this row**, on the same terms as `PR5D-TOOLBOX-DISCARDS-CLIPPY-OUTPUT`.

Two things, and they are separable:

1. **Make attribution structural rather than a reading discipline.** The wrapper already knows both facts it needs: the slot it took and the directory it was invoked from. Stamping a slot with its current occupant and reacting when that changes turns "check that the output named your path" from a rule every session must remember into an invariant the wrapper holds. Whether the reaction is a `cargo clean -p` or a refusal is a cost decision this row does not make — a clean on every occupant change costs a full crate rebuild, which is the cost the slot pool exists to avoid, so the answer may be to widen the pool, or to bind slots to worktrees for gate runs only.
2. **Answer the mechanism question above**, because a repair that only stamps the slot leaves the stale-serve unexplained: if cargo can consider a foreign warm slot fresh, that is worth knowing independently of this wrapper.

**A guard the repair should carry, and the oracle it still needs.** The shape is: build worktree A in slot N, then build worktree B in slot N, and assert that B's run either recompiled for B or was refused. **This row does not supply the oracle for that assertion, and an earlier version of it named one that does not work.** `<slot>/debug/libupstroke.d` describes `debug/libupstroke.rlib`, the library artifact; a `cargo test` run executes `debug/deps/upstroke-<hash>`, which is a different file with its own dependency file. So the top-level `.d` **does not identify the test executable a run used**, and it cannot attribute a test result to a worktree. Whoever takes this up has to establish an oracle that names the executable actually run — the wrapper knows the slot it took and the directory it was invoked from, so a stamp it writes itself is the more promising direction than anything inferred from cargo's output tree.

Until then the workaround is the one this pull request used and the standing rules require: `cargo clean -p upstroke` through the wrapper before each gate command, and quote the line naming the crate path. A run without that line is not evidence, whatever its exit code.

Recorded 2026-09-10 on `docs/findings-triage-locations`, from finding 3 of the review of `e8fcbdd8` — the sixth round on PR #262, which the repair brief numbered 7 — and it labelled the **recording omission** P3; **P2** here is this pass's judgement of the defect from the consequence above, matching `PR5D-TOOLBOX-DISCARDS-CLIPPY-OUTPUT`, the other row whose subject is this file, and `category: correctness` is the closest word in the closed vocabulary for a build-infrastructure defect, as that row also records. **Filed as an independent observation, not a member of `CLASS-INTERMITTENT-SUBPROCESS-KILL-SETTLE-RESIDUE-FAILURES`**: that class's four members are a macOS pre-exec process group, two Windows settle-kill signatures and a Linux empty-gitdir residue, every one an intermittent failure of the product under test, whereas the slot allocation demonstrated above is a deterministic property of the wrapper and reproducible on demand. Folding it in would put a tooling defect inside a class whose subject is the engine's own kill and settle paths. `MAINTAINING.md` step 5 is why it is a file: every open finding gets one, including one unrelated to the change that found it.
