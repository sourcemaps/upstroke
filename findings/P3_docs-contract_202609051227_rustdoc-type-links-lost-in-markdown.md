guard: Render the notes as GitHub Markdown and verify that the Epoch and IncarnationId references link to their actual definitions in src/topology/events.rs.
---

## Failure sequence

A reader opens the migrated settlement notes and follows the type references distinguishing Epoch from IncarnationId. Lines 40 and 43 retain rustdoc destinations beginning with crate::, which the Markdown renderer does not resolve as Rust items. GitHub's rendered response for the exact reviewed SHA contains plain code elements for these references and no hyperlinks. The reader loses the navigation that rustdoc supplied before the migration.

The independent review preserved that response in evidence-41eb825d/settle-rendered.html. The corresponding definitions are src/topology/events.rs:274 and src/topology/events.rs:259. Other shortcut rustdoc references in these notes also render as bracketed text, so the follow-up should inspect those references too.

## What the change that takes this up should do

Convert the moved rustdoc references to Markdown links that work in the intended reader context, with source or notes targets for the named items. A repository backlink to settle.rs does not identify these definitions in events.rs. Record this finding and defer repair under DOCS_FAST_TRACK.md.
