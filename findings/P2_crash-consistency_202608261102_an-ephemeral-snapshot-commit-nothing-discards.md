## Failure sequence

The snapshot worktree's ephemeral commit is reachable after a coordinator death mid-attempt,
and nothing discards it. The residue sits inside the run's own private root, so it is contained,
but it is not reclaimed.

## What the change that takes this up should do

Rule on the classification first. §38 reclassifies this from deferrable to **blocked**: the
packet and the tests classify the commit as Git-owned R27 and require recovery to leave it in
place, so deleting it would contradict an explicit contract. An implementer cannot repair around
that — what is needed is an owner packet decision that reclassifies the commit, and only then a
reclaim path.

Recorded in `reviews/FINDINGS.md` §20 and reclassified by §38. Severity is this migration's judgement.
