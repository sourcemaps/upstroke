# CLAUDE.md

Context for Claude Code sessions working on this repository.

## What upstroke is

A headless orchestration engine for AI coding agents, in Rust. It normalises an annotated markdown
plan into a dependency graph of typed tasks, dispatches each to an existing coding-agent CLI with a
model chosen per task, verifies results through objective gates and strong-model review, escalates
failures up an explicit model chain, and commits only what passes.

**It is the conductor, not an instrument.** It never edits a file, never implements an agentic
loop, and never calls a model API. Agents edit; the engine subprocesses their official CLIs and
owns git.

The binding invariants are `DESIGN.md` §4 (`design/04_design_invariants.md`). There are seven.
The ones a change is most likely to trip over:

- **Agents edit files; the engine owns git.** Agents are told never to commit.
- **The engine never speaks HTTP.** All model interaction is inside agent subprocesses.
- **Ground truth is the diff, not the transcript.**
- **Every state transition is an event.** State is derived by replaying `events.jsonl`; resume is
  replay-then-continue. There is no second path.
- **Official CLIs only.** No ToS-violating proxies.

Read §4 in full before touching the engine, the event log, or anything that handles capacity or
questions.

## Where the project is

`0.1.0` is released: the sequential conductor works end to end. v0.2 is in progress. Its
parallel-execution machinery (worktree-per-task, the compare-and-swap merge queue, the optional
container runner, the topology layer) reached master on 2026-09-01, inert by default: the v0.1
path is unchanged and the schema-4 machinery engages only by explicit schema choice.
`export-decisions` landed 2026-08-12. Still to come: capacity-driven routing (the capacity engine
ships read-only), more adapters, notifiers. No `0.2.0` tag exists. The build order is `DESIGN.md`
§21 and it is deliberate; check where the project is before adding something out of sequence.

**`DESIGN.md` is the only living authority for product design**, indexed at the root and split
into `design/` by section. `CODING_STANDARDS.md` indexes the implementation standards in
`standards/`. `MAINTAINING.md` is the change lifecycle. When a decision changes the design, the
section changes in the same pull request; there is no separate decision record to keep in step
(the decisions, proposals and acceptance directories were retired on 2026-09-03; the DESIGN.md
index says where each record's substance now lives).

## Gates

CI enforces these on every pull request to master. Run them from the repository root:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets --all-features
cargo +1.85.0 check --locked --all-targets --all-features
bash .github/scripts/test-release-record.sh
bash .github/scripts/test-pr-policy.sh
bash .github/scripts/test-pr-ledger-evidence.sh
bash .github/scripts/test-docs-consistency.sh
bash .github/scripts/test-internals-notes.sh
bash .github/scripts/test-pr-ready-audit.sh
```

The crate defines no features today, so `--all-features` is a no-op; use the CI form regardless.
`1.85.0` is the MSRV and CI pins it; there is **no** `rust-toolchain.toml`, so toolchain selection
is explicit at call sites. The 6 `test-*.sh` gates in `.github/scripts/` run in CI's `lint` job.
`test-release-record.sh` needs `jq`. `test-pr-policy.sh` derives its own directory with
`${BASH_SOURCE[0]%/*}`, which works from any directory except one: invoked by bare name from
inside `.github/scripts/`, the expansion strips nothing and it fails. Invoke it by path, as above.
These are CI's commands; a shared build machine may wrap `cargo` and assign target directories
itself, and its wrapper is the way to run them there.

## Hard conventions

Read the `standards/` sections a change touches. In particular:

- **Edition 2024, MSRV 1.85.**
- **The §7 panic policy is lint-enforced at its centre, a review duty at its edges.** `.unwrap()`
  is denied everywhere, tests included; `.expect()` and `panic!` are denied outside tests via
  `Cargo.toml`'s `[lints]`. Indexing, slicing and `unreachable!` are denied by §7 on the same
  terms but have no lint yet, so they bind by review under the activation rule.
- **`anyhow` only at the binary edge.** Libraries return `thiserror` types.
- **All paths through `std::path`.** Windows is a first-class target; CI runs the full matrix on
  ubuntu, macos and windows.
- **No shared ownership, locks, or non-trivial clones without a stated reason, every `?`
  deliberate, and no panicking index, slice or `unreachable!` outside an `#[expect]`** (§6, §7).
  These bind the code a change adds or rewrites; `standards/SWEEP.md` states the activation rule
  and tracks the file-by-file cleanup of the existing tree.
- **Conventional commit titles**, enforced on PR titles by `.github/scripts/validate-pr-body.sh`:
  `type(optional-scope): summary`, type one of feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, ci, build,
  perf, security, release, revert.

## How a change lands

`MAINTAINING.md` is authoritative. In outline: draft PR early; the ten gates and both required
contexts (`upstroke-ci`, `upstroke-pr-policy`) green; one frontier review of the exact green head
(`gpt-5.6-sol` at `max`, the verdict posted to the PR as one SHA-bound comment); triage: serious
P1s relevant to the change are fixed and re-reviewed; a `MUST` deviation in touched code and any
finding carrying a failing test, reproduction or mutation witness are fixed whatever their label;
everything else is fixed or logged as a tech-debt ledger row; enqueue once green, and the merge
queue lands the merge commit after both contexts pass on the entry it builds. The PR body
must carry the six sections and the exact canonical ledger header; run `validate-pr-body.sh`
against it locally.

Merging is the owner's act, and since 2026-09-12 the delegation of it is standing rather than
written per PR: the agent doing the work merges once the bar is met, and the body records that the
merge was made under standing delegation and by which agent. **The standing form reaches a PR only
where nothing in its diff can change what a required check runs, or how it judges what it ran, and
nothing in its diff amends this rule.** Two limbs, and a PR clears both.

**First limb.** Ask it of every changed path: *were this file written to deceive, could a required
check report success without having done its work?* What settles it is what the file **governs**,
not what kind of file it is. An **instrument** decides whether *other* changes are permitted — the
gate scripts, the CI-contract tests, and the lint, toolchain and runner configuration a check is
handed. A **subject** is what is being changed and whatever asserts against it, **its own regression
tests included**. The line is not "is it a test" and not "can its assertions be edited", because
both hold of every test here: `no_repository_file_overrides_what_ci_compiles_or_runs` asserts a fact
about this repository's CI configuration and so governs what everyone else may land — an instrument
— where `only_the_line_builder_introduces_terminal_layout` asserts a fact about the product and
governs nothing outside `src/util/terminal.rs` — a subject. **So an ordinary fix, and the regression
test `MAINTAINING.md` requires of it, is a subject that standing delegation reaches.** A `yes`, or
an honest *I cannot tell*, leaves the PR with the owner — or with a delegation the owner wrote for
that PR. Known instruments, **not a closed set, and not a checklist that clears a PR by omission**:
`.github/workflows/` and `.github/scripts/`; `scripts/`, which
`.github/scripts/test-pr-ready-audit.sh` sources and executes, so an edit there alone can make that
gate exit `0` without running a fixture; `.cargo/` and a root toolchain file, which rebind the
compiler every leg runs and the runner every compiled test harness is handed to; `Cargo.toml`'s
`[lints]` block; the CI-contract tests under `src/effects/`; the effect allowlists.

**Second limb: this rule itself.** Amending the delegation rule, or the review and triage required
before a merge, changes no gate, so the first limb clears it — and the amended rule can then license
the gate change the first limb exists to stop. An amendment to these paragraphs in `CLAUDE.md` and
`AGENTS.md`, to `MAINTAINING.md` step 7 or its trust boundary, or to `findings/PROCESS.md`
is the owner's, or carries a delegation written for that PR. It is a separate clause, not another
path on the list above.

Classifying the diff is the delegate's duty and no check enforces either limb — no required check
reads this rule. A delegation written for a class of PRs — every P1 fix, say — does not
satisfy the exception, however it is worded: it was written before the PR existed, so it cannot be
the owner's read of that PR's diff. `MAINTAINING.md` step 7 governs.

## Where things are

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `DESIGN.md`, `design/` | The design; §4 invariants, §21 build order, §25 export schema |
| `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `standards/` | Implementation standards, one section per file; `standards/SWEEP.md` |
| `MAINTAINING.md` | Change lifecycle, trust boundary, release contract |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contributor rules and CLA |
| `docs/internals/` | Internal module notes, one file per module mirroring `src/`. A module with notes carries a single `Extended notes:` pointer in its header and no other prose (§13), held both ways by `test-internals-notes.sh`. `docs/` is also the GitHub Pages source for upstroke.rs, so anything added there is published |
| `.github/scripts/` | The 6 `test-*.sh` gates and the `validate-*` helpers they exercise |
| `scripts/pr-ready-audit.sh` | Lane readiness audit: maintains `lane:*` and `ready-to-merge`, enqueues with `--enqueue` |
| `findings/` | The standing finding ledger, one file per open finding, moved here from under `reviews/` on 2026-09-12; `findings/README.md` names and shapes a finding, `findings/PROCESS.md` is how the ledger is worked |
| `reviews/` | `reviews/FINDINGS.md`, the same ledger up to 2026-09-04, closed to new sections, and the dated review records still on master; historical review records moved to the private lab repository on 2026-09-04 |
| `effects/` | The effect-governance allowlists the `src/effects/tests.rs` census enforces |

`src/` is one crate: `plan/` (ingestion), `agent/` (the Claude Code, Copilot and Codex adapters,
with `proc/` for subprocess handling), `engine/` (the conductor), `topology/` (the v0.2 execution
topology), `runner/` (host and container execution), `events/`, `validate/`, `status/`,
`effects/`, `connect/`, and flat modules such as `review.rs`, `gates.rs`, `ladder.rs`, `route.rs`,
`capacity.rs`, `rundir.rs`, `workspace.rs`, `workspace_manager.rs`, `export.rs`. Large modules
are being split into per-concern children; check the tree rather than this list.

## Traps that have already cost time

**Exit codes and output disagree.** `codex login status` prints "Not logged in" and exits **0**.
`git rev-parse <unknown-ref>` echoes its argument to stdout and errors only on stderr. Use
`git rev-parse --verify --quiet`, and never trust a bare `$?`.

**Non-interactive shells get nothing from `~/.bashrc`.** It opens with
`case $- in *i*) ;; *) return;; esac`. Agent subprocesses and `ssh host 'cmd'` are
non-interactive; anything they need must be sourced above that guard.

**Verify by hash, not by line count.** A one-character edit does not move a line count.

**A worker that dies without a report may have left a mutation applied.** Diff against the last
verified state before trusting a tree.

**Imperative success is not persistent success.** Verify that state survives a reboot.

**Concurrent suites must not share an unset `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.** The container pre-clean key is
fixed when the variable is unset (`src/runner/container/fake.rs`, `R5-SEAMS-006`), so two bare
`cargo test` runs on one machine remove each other's live Docker containers mid-run. Concurrent
runs need distinct target directories, assigned however the machine assigns them (a build wrapper
that owns them, or an explicit `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per run where nothing does); never two runs on
one unset value. CI is unaffected.

**`src/export.rs` pins sentences in the docs.** Its tests `include_str!` `README.md`,
`MAINTAINING.md`, `design/15_design_event_log_resume_run_layout.md` and
`design/25_design_export_decisions_schema.md`; a rewording there fails the suite.

**`reviews/findings/` must not exist.** The finding ledger moved to `findings/` on 2026-09-12 (PR
#276), and git tracks files, not directories: a branch cut before the move that adds a finding under
the old prefix merges with no conflict and recreates the directory, holding findings nothing reads.
`test-docs-consistency.sh` (C5) fails on any tracked path under the old prefix; the remedy is to
rebase onto `master` and `git mv` the file under `findings/`.
