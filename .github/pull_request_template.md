## Review evidence

Implementation model and effort (or `human`):

Reviewed head SHA:

Frontier reviewer model and effort:

Review transport and per-pass wall-clock limit:

Durable review verdict URL (the verdict as written):

Clean base merge-in, if used (reviewed SHA, merged head, old and new base SHAs, diff hash before and after, recomputed on the trusted side):

- [ ] `upstroke-ci` and `upstroke-pr-policy` passed before frontier review began
- [ ] The independent frontier review used `max` effort on the reviewed head recorded above
- [ ] Every serious P1 is fixed and its repaired head received a fresh pass; every `MUST` deviation in materially touched code and every finding carrying a failing test, reproduction, or mutation witness is `fixed`, or `rejected` only by a row showing the evidence is not valid (a `MUST` the code does not breach, a witness that does not reproduce on the head), never `accepted-risk` or `deferred`; every other finding carries a ledger row (`fixed`, `rejected`, `deferred`, or `accepted-risk`)
- [ ] `Reviewed head SHA` above is the head being merged, or the delta to it is exempt-only (confined to the finding ledger, `findings/` or `reviews/FINDINGS.md`; or a conflict-free base merge-in with the diff hash recomputed unchanged on the trusted side, CI green on the merged head, and no workflow, gate script, or validator edited by this pull request, evidence in the field above) or a non-serious repair-only delta owner-verified and disclosed (single-reviewer passes only: a panel-reviewed candidate re-runs every seat on any head movement)
- [ ] Every review conversation is resolved
