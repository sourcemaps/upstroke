# The pure parts of scripts/pr-ready-audit.sh and the whole of scripts/pr-review-parse.py,
# exercised against fixtures: the lane and its severity set, both review forms (the workflow's
# fenced JSON verdict and the frontier prose form) and the ledger, all four of which the one
# parser reads; the reader that takes its payload; the state a set of blockers puts a pull request
# in; the frontmatter id match and the newest-check-run choice.
# Everything that talks to GitHub is out of scope here, with one exception: the argument parser and
# the audit's own refusals are exercised by running the script as a process against a stub `gh`,
# because the defects they have had live in `main` and no call on the helpers can see them. git is
# in scope in one place, `finding_file_count`, which is run against a small repository this file
# builds: reading a list of names is where a shape rule stops helping and only a count will do. The stub answers every call
# with a marker and a failure, so an argument that should have been refused and instead reached
# GitHub shows up as a failed case rather than a live request. The audit's behaviour on a real
# pull request is still observed on the pull request.
#
# Needs `jq` as well as bash: the comment filter is a jq program, and running it is the only way
# to prove the trusted login reaches it as data rather than as program text.
#
# Each case names the defect it exists to catch, so a green run says what it proved:
#   MUT-LANE-LABEL-INPUT         the lane came from a label, not the branch prefix
#   MUT-LANE-TABLE-DRIFT         a prefix's lane, review effort or must-fix set disagreed with
#                                scripts/lane.sh's table -- asserted for all thirteen prefixes and
#                                not a sample, because the table this replaces WAS a sample: three
#                                `codex/` shapes and a catch-all, and every real prefix fell into
#                                the catch-all
#   MUT-LANE-PREFIX-UNKNOWN-DEFAULTS  a branch outside the vocabulary was given a lane instead of a
#                                refusal, which is how an unknown prefix was silently handed the
#                                most expensive review and the loosest fix set
#   MUT-LANE-LABEL-LIST-BY-HAND  the label list, or the label reconciliation, named lanes by hand
#                                instead of following the table, so it went stale the moment the
#                                table moved and left a retired `lane:*` label uncorrected
#   MUT-LANE-LABEL-SPLIT-ON-SPACES  the labels arrived as one space-joined field and every reader
#                                of it split on whitespace, which is not a label's boundary: a
#                                label named `lane:legacy docs` was reported and removed as
#                                `lane:legacy`, the removal of a label the pull request does not
#                                carry failed, and the run ended there with every pull request
#                                after it unaudited -- or a single label containing
#                                `ready-to-merge` was taken for the ready label, the same way
#   MUT-P3-EFFORT-FROM-LANE-ALONE  the P3 row's effort ignored the branch, or read the category as
#                                a PREFIX of the slug rather than as the whole first token -- so
#                                `bulk-fix-P3/docs-contract-cleanup` was reviewed at low effort --
#                                or answered low for a caller that passed no branch at all, which
#                                cheapens a review by omission
#   MUT-P3-COUNT-UNBOUNDED       the P3 lane had no tolerance: either `verdict-not-pass` still
#                                demanded a PASS no review could give, or the unwitnessed P3s were
#                                not counted against three, or a witnessed one was counted as
#                                unwitnessed
#   MUT-P3-LANE-DEFERS           the P3 lane let a P3 be deferred
#   MUT-JSON-SPLIT-BY-REGEX      findings read by splitting text on "},{" instead of a parser
#   MUT-NULL-WITNESS             a null witness field counted as a witness
#   MUT-MUST-UNSEEN              a MUST deviation was not flagged
#   MUT-BAD-SEVERITY-PASSES      a P9 finding passed as deferrable
#   MUT-STRAY-TOKEN-UNSEEN       a severity token outside the verdict object was ignored
#   MUT-VERDICT-FROM-PROSE       the verdict was read from prose, not the object with the findings
#   MUT-QUOTED-JSON-IS-JSON      a prose review quoting JSON was parsed as the JSON form
#   MUT-PROSE-HEADING-FINDING    a prose P1 written as a heading vanished
#   MUT-PROSE-LAST-VERDICT       the first VERDICT line won over the last
#   MUT-FRONTMATTER-BY-SUBSTRING an id in prose satisfied the frontmatter match
#   MUT-FRONTMATTER-PATTERN      an id with a dot matched as a regex
#   MUT-CHECK-RUN-FIRST-SUCCESS  an older success outranked a newer failure
#   MUT-CHECK-RUN-UNSTARTED      an unstarted run was ordered by a stand-in date, not its id
#   MUT-LEDGER-HEADER-AS-ROW     the header or separator line parsed as a row
#   MUT-REVIEWER-FROM-ORG        an organization owner was trusted as the reviewer, so the
#                                comment filter matched nothing and every pull request read
#                                no-review
#   MUT-REVIEWER-OVERRIDE-IGNORED  an explicit --reviewer was not preferred over the owner
#   MUT-REVIEWER-JQ-INJECTION    the trusted login was spliced into the comment filter's program
#                                text, so a value shaped like jq widened the author predicate to
#                                every commenter and another account's PASS became the verdict
#   MUT-REVIEWER-CASE-MISMATCH   the author comparison was case-sensitive, so naming the correct
#                                account in another spelling hid its blocking review as no-review
#   MUT-REVIEWER-ARG-EATEN       --reviewer read the next argument without checking it was one, so
#                                a following option was consumed as the login and switched off
#   MUT-REVIEWER-NULL-AUTHOR     the comment filter raised on a comment whose author is null, which
#                                failed the whole page it was on and dropped every review with it
#   MUT-REVIEW-LOOKUP-SUPPRESSED a failed comment lookup was reported as "no review", so the audit
#                                judged whatever survived the failure and an older PASS could win
#   MUT-TIMELINE-LOOKUP-SUPPRESSED  a failed timeline lookup was reported as "the base did not
#                                change", which is the check standing between a retarget and an
#                                enqueue
#   MUT-RULESET-LOOKUP-SUPPRESSED   a failed ruleset lookup was reported as "no ruleset requires an
#                                up-to-date branch", which drops the BEHIND blocker for the run
#   MUT-LOGIN-LOCALE-RANGE       the login check used a collating range, so what counted as an
#                                ASCII letter came from the locale and `evéntloops` was a login
#   MUT-REVIEWER-ENV-BEFORE-FLAG an inherited environment value was validated before the flag that
#                                replaces it, so a stale setting refused a run that never used it
#   MUT-REVIEWER-EMPTY-OVERRIDE  an empty --reviewer counted as no --reviewer, so an unset shell
#                                variable expanded into the flag moved trust to the repository owner
#   MUT-LIST-UNPAGINATED         a collection was read without --paginate, so page one was taken
#                                for the whole list and an active ruleset on page two was invisible
#   MUT-OPTION-LONE-HYPHEN       the option guard required a character after the hyphen, so a lone
#                                `-` was taken as a label name
#   MUT-REVIEW-PARSE-TRUNCATED   a parser that died partway printed a shorter findings list, and a
#                                shorter findings list is a weaker verdict, not an error
#   MUT-PROSE-READ-SUPPRESSED    a read that failed inside the parse was reported as "nothing
#                                matched", and the completeness marker was printed over it -- so a
#                                prose review carrying a P3 under a PASS parsed as a clean PASS
#                                with no findings. There is no read inside the parse for a status
#                                to be suppressed on now: the input is read once, and a read that
#                                failed is a parse that failed
#   MUT-META-FIELD-COLLAPSE      an empty META field let `read` with IFS=tab shift every column
#                                after it, so a review recording no commit read as one that did
#   MUT-PR-LOOKUP-SUPPRESSED     a failed pull-request read left empty fields to be audited
#   MUT-PR-LIST-SUPPRESSED       a failed open-pull-request listing read as "nothing is open"
#   MUT-FAIL-OPEN-SHAPE          a read whose failure cannot be seen: `for x in $(gh ...)`,
#                                `< <(gh ...)`, `|| true` on a gh or git command, or a gh or git
#                                command piped where the pipeline's status is read as an answer
#   MUT-FINDING-FILE-COUNT       the filed-finding count read a listing wrongly -- an error taken
#                                for "no files", or NUL-separated names put through `$(...)`,
#                                which drops NUL and leaves nothing to read
#   MUT-FINDING-FILE-READ-AS-MISS  a finding file the count could not read counted as a file that
#                                does not carry the id, so two files filing one id became one
#   MUT-FINDING-LEDGER-PREFIX-HISTORICAL  the count named only the ledger's CURRENT prefix while
#                                its caller passes a pull request's own head, so a head cut before
#                                the 2026-09-12 move counted 0 files for a finding filed once and
#                                the audit answered NOT-READY, `no-file:<id>`, at exit 0
#   MUT-REVIEW-FORGES-PROTOCOL   a review string carrying the parser's own separators wrote rows
#                                of the parser's language, END among them, and the audit read a
#                                finished parse from a marker instead of from a status
#   MUT-PARSE-WRITE-UNCHECKED    a protocol write returned EIO and the parse reported success, so
#                                one finding vanished from a findings list that still announced
#                                itself complete -- READY, and a merge call
#   MUT-PARSE-PAYLOAD-COUNT      the payload the audit reads did not declare how many records it
#                                carries, so a read that stopped part way was a shorter list
#   MUT-MANUAL-SCAN-FAILS-OPEN   the manual-blocker test was a command in a condition, which has
#                                two ways to be false: the answer, and a failure. `grep` exiting 2
#                                left state=READY with the blocker printed beside it
#   MUT-LEDGER-LOOKUP-SUPPRESSED a pull-request body the audit could not fetch was read as a body
#                                with no ledger rows in it, which is `no-row` for a filed finding
#   MUT-FRONTMATTER-UPSTREAM-ERROR-AS-MISS  the frontmatter read was a pipeline, so under
#                                `pipefail` the reader's failure (2) stood behind the matcher's
#                                ordinary "no match" (1) and the caller was handed an answer
#   MUT-PROSE-VERDICT-SUFFIX     the verdict check was anchored at one end, so it validated the
#                                TAIL of the token and read `VERDICT: FAIL<U+00C9>PASS` as PASS --
#                                and read it differently under `C`, in a file whose header
#                                forbids locale-dependent output
#   MUT-PROSE-HEAD-NOT-FIRST     the head check searched the whole listing instead of its first
#                                line, so a first marker it could not read was stepped over and a
#                                later line's commit came back as the reviewed head
#   MUT-FINDING-SYMLINK-AS-FILE  the candidate listing dropped the mode git records, so a
#                                `120000` symlink was read as a file and its TARGET STRING as
#                                that file's frontmatter
#   MUT-PROSE-VERDICT-SALVAGE    a verdict token that failed the whole-token check was handed to
#                                a fallback that stripped the leading colons and asterisks off
#                                it, so `VERDICT: ::PASS` -- rejected one line earlier -- came
#                                back out of the rejecting branch as `PASS`
#   MUT-FINDING-BLOB-OPEN-AS-MISS  the blob the matcher was to read could not be OPENED, so the
#                                redirection returned 1 with the matcher never run -- and 1 was
#                                the matcher's own word for "does not carry the id"
#   MUT-FINDING-LIST-SHORT-READ  the candidate listing stopped arriving part way through and the
#                                entries that had arrived were counted as all of them: `read`
#                                ends a loop at end of input and at a failed read alike
#   MUT-REVIEW-KIND-UNREADABLE-IS-PROSE  a format detection that could not read the file chose
#                                the prose parser, which reads a JSON review's `VERDICT:` line
#                                from outside its verdict object and misses every severity the
#                                object spells with a JSON escape. Detection is inside the one
#                                parser now, so a file it cannot read has no format at all
#   MUT-RETARGET-ANSWER-UNCHECKED  a helper's ANSWER is a write, and the write's failure was
#                                discarded: `{ echo yes; return 0; }` left the caller an empty
#                                string and a status of 0, `[[ "$x" == yes ]]` read that as "the
#                                base did not change", and a pull request retargeted since its
#                                review enqueued. The same case covers every channel that carries
#                                an answer back: the retarget `yes`/`no`, the ruleset's two flags,
#                                the comment id, and the lane's severity set -- each names its
#                                permissive answer and blocks on everything else
#   MUT-VERDICT-REVIVED-BY-TRUNCATION  the workflow form's verdict was the last block THAT PARSED
#                                rather than the last block, so a final object missing its closing
#                                fence or its final `}` was stepped over and the `PASS` quoted
#                                above it as an example became the verdict -- with the real
#                                object's `"P\u0031"` invisible to the stray scan
#   MUT-VERDICT-REVIVED-BY-INDENT  the verdict block was recognised by `^```json`, which is not
#                                CommonMark's rule: a fence may carry up to three leading spaces
#                                and its closing fence may be indented independently. One space
#                                before the real `CHANGES_REQUIRED` object and it stopped being a
#                                block at all, so the `PASS` quoted above it as an example became
#                                the verdict -- READY and a merge call, with `"P\u0031"` invisible
#                                to the stray scan. The case pins the recogniser AND the rule that
#                                stands when a recogniser is wrong again: the verdict is the
#                                comment's LAST block, and nothing that could be another block's
#                                material may follow it
#   MUT-VERDICT-AMBIGUOUS-BLOCK-CHOSEN  the parse CHOSE between the places a verdict could be read
#                                from instead of refusing a comment that offers more than one.
#                                Three spellings of one fenced block, each making the WRONG block
#                                the one that was read: `{ "role_understanding"` with a space
#                                after the brace, which the tail check's enumeration of "block
#                                material" did not list; the real block inside a blockquote's
#                                `> `, which the recogniser did not see at all, so format
#                                detection fell back to prose and took the `VERDICT: PASS` written
#                                outside it; and a second block hidden inside an HTML comment,
#                                which a reader never sees and the scanner read as the last block.
#                                All three reached READY, exit 0 and one merge call out of a
#                                review carrying a P1 spelled `"P\u0031"`, which the stray scan
#                                cannot see either. A recogniser made cleverer closes the spelling
#                                in front of it; the count closes the class: EXACTLY ONE place a
#                                verdict may be read from, every fence run in the comment
#                                accounted for by the structure scan, nothing but whitespace after
#                                the block, no `VERDICT:` line outside it, and the form taken from
#                                the comment's marker rather than from whichever parser answers
#   MUT-BLOCK-CONTENT-NOT-MATERIAL  the CONTENT of a block the verdict was not read from was
#                                treated as inert by both the fence accounting and the candidate
#                                count, which looked only OUTSIDE the blocks the structure scan
#                                found. Accounting for every fence run says each one WAS consumed
#                                as a fence and nothing about WHICH block it went into: CommonMark
#                                suppresses a fence inside a raw-HTML block and this scan does not,

#                                sees, it swallowed the real blocking verdict as its content, every
#                                run stayed accounted for, and a clean `PASS` appended after it was
#                                the only candidate left -- READY, exit 0, no blocker, out of a
#                                comment a CommonMark parse sees one CHANGES_REQUIRED verdict in.
#                                The same blind spot read from the other end left a `text`-fenced
#                                `role_understanding` object out of the count, so the count reached

#                                it to find, and the one check standing between an object outside
#                                the verdict block and READY found nothing. Both spellings are
#                                read now, and a doubled backslash is still not an escape
#   MUT-JSON-REPEATED-NAME-CHOSEN  the verdict object was decoded with unrestricted
#                                `json.loads`, which KEEPS THE LAST OCCURRENCE of a repeated
#                                name: a `findings` array carrying a P1 followed by a second
#                                `"findings":[]` deserialised to a clean PASS with no findings at
#                                all, the blocking array discarded before validation saw it and
#                                the severity spelled `P\u0031` so the stray scan could not see it
#                                either -- READY and a merge call out of a review that blocks. One
#                                level down the same shape erases a witness instead. The decode
#                                builds every object through a hook that refuses a repeated name,

# reproduction or mutation witness is fixed whatever the count and is already blocked in every lane.

# a review the stub can serve has no ledger row and no filed finding behind it, so every one of

# --- what a block SWALLOWS is material, and so is a severity only a decoder can read ------------
# TWO FINDINGS, ONE BLIND SPOT, WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE ONE SECTION. `unresolved_material` accounted
# for every fence run OUTSIDE the blocks the structure scan found, and `verdict_candidates` looked
# for the bare form's object opener in exactly the same place -- so the CONTENT of a block neither
# of them read the verdict from was inert to both, and a verdict sitting in it was invisible twice.
#
# It is not inert. CommonMark suppresses a fence inside a raw-HTML block and this scan does not
# (https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#html-blocks), so `<!--`, a ```text line and `-->` open a
# block HERE that a reader of the comment never sees, and that block SWALLOWS the real verdict as
# its content. Every fence run stays accounted for -- each one WAS consumed as a fence, just into
# the wrong block, and accounting for runs says nothing about which block each went into -- the
# swallowed object is not a candidate, and a clean `PASS` appended after it is the only candidate
# left. Measured on this file's own stub with the head replaced by a real commit:
# READY, exit 0, verdict=PASS, zero findings, no blocker at all, out of a comment `markdown-it-py`
# 3.0.0 parses to exactly one fenced verdict -- CHANGES_REQUIRED, carrying a P1.
#
# The same blind spot counted from the other end is the second finding: a `text`-fenced
# `role_understanding` object is not a candidate either, so the count reaches ZERO -- and zero was a
# road to the prose parser, which read the `VERDICT: PASS` line written underneath it. One repair
# closes both, because a block the verdict was not read FROM is now accounted for on the same terms
# as the material outside one: a line of its content shaped like the opening fence of a `json`
# block, and the bare form's object opener, are material and there is no result.
#
# AND THE UNCLOSED `<!--` IS A SPELLING, NOT THE CLASS. `<div>` (HTML block type 6, ended by a blank
# line), `<pre>` (type 1, ended by its closing tag) and any complete tag on a line of its own start
# HTML blocks too. Each is a case below, with the swallowing fence spelled six ways, because a rule
