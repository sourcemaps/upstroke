# checked and what was parsed were three different reads of one name. A
# replacement landed -- atomically, by rename -- in the window between them, and
# the ambiguous name conformed at exit 0 over `warning: command substitution:
# ignored null byte in input` where the unreplaced listing refuses it at exit 1.
#
# THE REVIEWER USED inotify TO LAND THAT WRITE; an exported shell FUNCTION is the
# same interception with nothing to install. It runs BEFORE the real command
# opens the file, so the replacement lands INSIDE the window rather than near it,
# and it fires on this listing's own path -- named as an argument, or standing as
# the command's standard input, which is what /proc is needed for.
#
# TWO THINGS ARE ASSERTED, and the second is what stops the first passing for the
# wrong reason. The verdict may not change, wherever the replacement lands; and
# no more than ONE of those commands may see the listing at all. The repaired
# read OPENS the caller's path exactly once, with `exec 9<` in the shell itself,
# and copies it to a private file; the one hooked command below is the `cat` that
# reads that ALREADY-OPEN descriptor, which opens nothing and cannot be handed a
# different inode by a rename. Measured: one, in all three cases.

# is repaired by the pull request, and is independently deleted on master. Once
# master has moved, `<base>..<head>` no longer reaches the branch point and the
# finding is in no listing at all.
#
# THAT IS NOT A CLAIM THAT THE VERDICT IS A FUNCTION OF THE HEAD. It is not, and
# the THIRD repository here pins the case where it legitimately changes: master
# merging a pull request that carries one of THIS branch's commits moves the
# merge base forward, and an ambiguous name becomes unambiguous with no push to
# the branch. That is the right answer rather than a hole -- whether a
# description names one finding or two is a property of the LEDGER, which other
# pull requests change -- and the two cases are drawn apart here so that neither
# can be read as the other.

# One description, two findings, one of them repaired here and deleted there:
# losing it leaves a single match and an AMBIGUOUS name conforms, which is the
# acceptance this whole gate exists to prevent.

# 120000, and 160000 was decided by WHERE DISCOVERY LANDED instead. An
# INITIALISED submodule at findings is a work tree of its own, so
# `rev-parse --show-toplevel` from inside it answers the SUBMODULE'S root, the
# listing is named by the empty path in THAT index, and the submodule's entries
# were read as this repository's ledger. Measured on a clean checkout -- `git
# status --porcelain` exit 0 and empty -- with a finding-shaped file at the
# submodule's root: the three tree listings refuse at exit 1, `names no finding`,
# and the same checkout's findings DIRECTORY conformed at exit 0. The
# superproject's gitlink is the authority, and a submodule's own index is not a
# statement about what THIS repository tracks.
#
# THE GITLINK IS BUILT WITH `update-index --cacheinfo` AND NOT WITH `submodule
# add`, which wants `protocol.file.allow` for a local path from git 2.38 and
# writes a `.gitmodules` no rule here reads. What makes the shape is the 160000
# entry in the superproject's index and a work tree git can discover beneath it;
# both are asserted before anything is judged, so a fixture that failed to build

# `findings/` answered exit 0 `conforms` where the three generated tree listings
# answered exit 1 `names 2 findings`, and that directory alone answered exit 1
# `names no finding` where the project's own ledger holds one. A false green, a
# false red, and two equivalent inputs disagreeing about one commit -- so all
# three input forms are asserted here, and against each other.

# REPOSITORIES AND NO GITLINK ANYWHERE is what that costs. `outer` tracks
# `project/seed.txt` and nothing else below `project`; `outer/project` is a
# repository of its own that ignores `nested/`; `outer/project/nested` is a
# repository whose ledger is at its own root. Nothing records `project/nested`
# -- but `records_path outer project` answers YES on an ANCESTOR MATCH, because
# `project/seed.txt` is under `project`, so the walker-subject ascent made
# `outer` the authority and the nested repository's ledger vanished with it:
# the same base listing beside that directory conformed at exit 0 where it
# refused at exit 1 `names 2 findings` beside a generated head listing of the
# same commit. `records_path outer project/nested` answers NO, and that is the
# question the loop asks now.
#
# AGREEMENT IS ASSERTED BETWEEN EQUIVALENT CANDIDATE SETS AND NOT BETWEEN ALL

# plus the same ledger DIRECTORY denote one set -- the twin at the boundary and
# the finding at the head -- and must answer alike. The directory ALONE denotes
# only what the checkout holds, which is one finding and not two, so exit 0

# AND ITS PAIR, WHERE THE ANCESTOR RECORDS THE LISTING ROOT ITSELF AND AUTHORITY
# REALLY DOES MOVE OUT. The two fixtures differ in ONE thing -- whether `outer`'s
# tracked file is UNDER the listing root or BESIDE it -- and they must answer
# differently, which is what makes the question above a question and not a
# formality. Here `outer` records `project/nested/tracked.txt`, so `project/nested`
# is a directory of OUTER'S ledger and what the repository somebody nested there
# holds is not this repository's record of that path: the listing names no
# finding, though a finding-shaped file is committed at the nested root.
#
# THIS ONE IS A GUARD AND NOT A RED WITNESS for the subject-fixed question: the
# walker-subject ascent reached `outer` here too, by the ANCESTOR match on
# `project`, and answered the same. It witnesses the half of `records_path` the
# new multi-component subject relies on -- that entries UNDER a path count as
# that path being recorded -- which the single-component subject never exercised.

# ---- A BARE REPOSITORY IN THE WAY IS NOT THE TOP OF THE WALK -----------------------------------
#
# `rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` answering `false` says THAT DIRECTORY has no
# work tree over it -- it is a bare repository, or the inside of a `.git`. Two
# places read it as "and nothing above records the listing either", which is a
# clause git had not said, and each gave a false green for it: a bare repository
# can sit inside a superproject that records the whole path.
#
# The shape is one superproject recording `findings` at 160000, an IGNORED bare
# repository at `findings/bare.git`, and a ledger under that. TWO ledgers are
# built on it, because the two readings are in different functions and one
# fixture reaches only one of them:
#
#   bare.git/nested   an ordinary repository, so the listing IS a work tree root,
#                     its name in its own index is empty, and `enclosing_work_tree`
#                     makes the ascent. That is the walk that stopped.
#   bare.git/holder   a PLAIN DIRECTORY, so `locate_listing`'s own discovery
#                     answers `false` FOR THE LISTING, and the `filesystem` world
#                     was chosen before any ascent could begin.
#
# AND THE WITNESS THAT SAYS WHICH DEFECT THIS IS: renaming `bare.git/HEAD` away
# stops that directory LOOKING bare, and at the previous head its presence alone
# decided the verdict -- exit 0 with the file, exit 1 without it -- while nothing
# about what any repository RECORDS changed. Both states must now refuse.

# ---- A WALK THAT CANNOT SHORTEN THE PATH DOES NOT TERMINATE ------------------------------------
#
# `enclosing_work_tree` ascends by `${parent%/*}`, and the test at the top of its
# loop is `$parent != /`. That pair bounds every POSIX path, because stripping a
# component off one always shortens it and `/` is what is left. IT DOES NOT BOUND
# A DRIVE ROOT: `C:/repo` strips to `C:`, and `C:` strips to `C:`.
#
# While a `false` from `--is-inside-work-tree` ENDED the walk, that was a wrong
# answer at such a root and nothing worse. The section above makes a `false` a
# reason to CONTINUE -- which is the right repair, and this is its cost -- and the
# same input is then an UNBOUNDED LOOP asking about `C:` for ever. Unbounded
# rather than slow, in a required check. `repository_above` and `locate_listing`
# both make the shortening test on the same arithmetic; this walk carried the
# comment that every step must move strictly upwards and not the test.
#
# NOTHING ON THIS PLATFORM CAN REACH IT -- every path git hands this ascent here
# begins with `/` -- so the function is driven directly with `git_probe` stubbed,
# which is what a native `C:/...` work-tree root would produce. That is the same
# kind of witness the walk's other root test has, and it is written down here
# rather than run by hand because a hand-run witness is not a gate.
#
# THE HARNESS IS BOUNDED BY A CALL CAP, NOT BY WALL CLOCK, so a regression FAILS
# rather than hangs CI, and it needs no `timeout` to do it: every turn of this
# loop probes, so counting probes counts turns, and the stub exits 124 on the
# cap+1'th. It asserts the probe's argument shape before reading it, so a call
# that stops looking like the one this stubs is a loud failure and not a silent
# pass.
#
# TWO DRIVE-ROOTED CASES, BECAUSE THEY PULL IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS: the walk must
# STOP at a drive root, and it must NOT stop at the bare boundary the section
# above is about -- a `false` under a work tree that does record the listing has
# to keep ascending. A POSIX row runs the same harness to show the terminator
# moved nothing there.

# `git ls-tree` C-QUOTES such a name into something that matches no finding at
# all, refused the same commit at exit 1.

# are here. TWO HALF REPAIRS WERE MEASURED. One read git's records whole and
# carried the names through the newline-delimited recorded-mode sets: the
# symlink case below conformed at exit 0, because a name holding a newline
# corrupts a membership test wherever it is put, and the real finding of that
# name tested as a member of the non-regular set and was dropped exactly as
# before. The other dropped nothing at all and printed such a name into the
# candidate set: the `named-by-no-file` case conformed at exit 0, a finding
# nothing has filed invented out of the tail of a name, where the trees refuse
# at exit 1. So the names are read whole AND the ones that cannot be carried are

# The third crop of the same defect. The examinability test was "can `.git/.` be
# reached", which is a test of SEARCH on the directory and says nothing about the
# files inside it. `chmod 000 .git/HEAD` -- or `.git/objects`, or `.git/refs` --
# leaves `.git` searchable and makes BOTH git probes exit 128 with the same words
# git uses for a directory that is not a repository at all, so the walk concluded
# "no repository", the filesystem fallback decided the entries, and the twin the
# index records and the checkout lacks was gone: exit 0 `conforms`, empty stderr,
# on the checkout that is exit 1 `names 2 findings` when the file is readable.
# Root can read anything, so the permission cases only mean something as an
# ordinary user.

# ---- a RECORDED ANCESTOR is followed too, and one listing has many spellings ------------------
#
# The entries were decided by the mode git records, and so was the listing path
# itself -- and the path ABOVE it was not. The ledger's own directory sits at the
# work tree's root, so no ancestor of it inside the repository can be a link; a
# directory handed in BY HAND is any path, and this is the rule for its
# ancestors. Commit `ledger` as a SYMLINK to a sibling directory holding a finding
# and git calls it a `120000 blob`, `git status` stays empty, and no tree entry
# and no index entry is NAMED `ledger/findings/...`: the tree listings hold no
# finding and refuse at exit 1. Handing `ledger/findings` straight in asked the
# index from INSIDE the link -- `git -C ledger` chdirs to `elsewhere` -- and
# resolved the name out of files no ledger holds at that path, at exit 0.
#
# AND THE SAME LISTING WRITTEN FIVE WAYS IS ONE LISTING. `findings/.`
# moved the question from `findings` to `.`, so the committed symlink AT
# `findings` that the plain spelling refused at exit 1 conformed at exit 0
# with three characters added. Every spelling is asserted, both for the paths that
# must refuse and for a real findings directory that must still resolve --

# ---- the sentinel is this primitive's OWN write, and its status is a status --------------------

# rather than an inconvenience is a listing whose own last byte IS the sentinel:
# fail only the STDOUT sentinel once the copy is written -- the real builtin
# `printf` exiting 1, `Bad file descriptor` -- and the INPUT'S trailing byte is
# mistaken for the marker the helper never wrote, and stripped as if it were that
# marker. A filename that was never filed appears and MATCHES. Measured against
# the unrepaired file: exit 0 `conforms` with empty stderr, where the same
# listing refuses at exit 1 with the write intact. A failed write there does not
# lose a finding, it MANUFACTURES one.
#
# THE INJECTION IS AN EXPORTED `printf` FUNCTION, which shadows the builtin in

# sentinel write is made against a closed descriptor. ONLY the stdout one --
# failing both is the weaker test the unrepaired file already refuses, because a

# ---- a starting path is a PATH and never an EXPRESSION -----------------------------------------
#
# `list_dir` handed a RELATIVE path straight to `find`, whose operands are a
# starting-point list followed by an EXPRESSION and which tells the two apart by
# SPELLING. A directory named `!` was read as the negation operator: `find !
# -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -print0` is exit 0 AND NO OUTPUT, so the enumeration was
# empty, an empty enumeration read as "this directory names no finding", and an
# ambiguous name conformed at exit 0 -- where the SAME directory named by its
# absolute path refused it at exit 1.
#
# EVERY RELATIVE PATH IS PREFIXED, and the fixture is a set of names rather than
# the one that was filed, because the hostile set belongs to the implementation
# and not to us. Measured on findutils 4.9.0: `(` is exit 1 `invalid expression`,
# a false red on a real listing; `-H` is exit 0 having enumerated the CURRENT
# directory, because it is an option and the starting-point list was then empty;
# and `)` and `,` are accepted as paths in leading position, which the next find
# need not do. Each name is asserted BOTH WAYS -- written relative and written
# absolute -- so what is checked is one listing giving one answer, not a table of
# exit codes that could all be wrong together.
#
# `-` IS ASSERTED ABSOLUTE ONLY, and deliberately. Bash's `cd` reads a bare `-`
# as `$OLDPWD` even after `--`, so the anchor probe in locate_listing answers
# about a different directory for that one spelling; that is a mechanism of its
# own and not this one, and a fixture that quietly depended on OLDPWD would be

# `C:` IS IN THAT LIST FOR THE OTHER HALF OF THE RULE, AND IT WITNESSES ONLY THE
# POSIX HALF. The prefix is for paths that are ACTUALLY RELATIVE, and on a native
# Windows shell `C:/…` is absolute and fails the `/` arm, so prefixing it builds
# `./C:/…`, which is no path at all. Measured in Git Bash on Windows Server 2025
# (bash 5.2.37, git 2.50.1.windows.1, findutils 4.10.0), on a directory inside a
# real `.git` -- where discovery answers `false` and the filesystem is the whole
# of the evidence: `find C:/… -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -print0` exit 0 and
# enumerates, `find ./C:/… …` exit 1 `No such file or directory`, and the
# validator itself refused the listing as "a directory whose entries could not be
# listed" where the same directory spelled `/c/…` answered `names 2 findings`.
#
# NONE OF THAT CAN FAIL ON POSIX, where `C:/x` is an ordinary relative path and
# `./C:/x` names the same directory, so THIS CASE IS NOT A RED WITNESS FOR THE
# WINDOWS REPAIR and nothing in this file is: the Windows run is the witness and
# the pull request body carries it. What this case does assert is the half that
# CAN regress here -- that a listing whose name begins with a drive designator,

# ---- THE LEDGER'S OLD PREFIX: THE HEAD IS THE CALLER'S, AND IT CAN PREDATE THE MOVE -----------
#
# changed-in-range.sh is handed the PULL REQUEST'S OWN head SHA -- pr-policy.yml reads it from the
# API and never uses the queue commit's tree -- while the script itself comes from the merge
# result. So every pull request whose head predates 2026-09-12 runs the CURRENT builder against a
# tree that keeps the ledger at reviews/findings/, and `git diff` with a pathspec matching nothing
# EXITS 0 WITH NO OUTPUT: the `|| exit 1` at the builder has no failure to propagate and the
# listing comes back empty. check_added_findings is the only rule that judges what a pull request
# FILES, so an empty listing is that rule not running.
#
# Measured on this fixture before the builder named both prefixes: case 1 answered 0 -- `conforms`
# -- where the identical tree laid out the new way answers 1. That is a gate PASSING a pull request
# it exists to stop, not a red somebody has to work around.
#
# Case 2 is why the builder's pathspec could not be widened on its own. With the old prefix added
# there and check_added_findings left judging `findings/?*`, a CLEAN pre-move pull request filing
# one valid finding was refused for naming `a path outside findings/` -- a false red on every pull
# request open across the move. The listing and the rule that reads it moved together.
#
# Case 4 is the rename direction, and it is the one a two-pathspec edit is supposed to blow up on:
# `-M` pairs a delete with an add only where BOTH ends are in the diff, so naming the old prefix is
# what makes the move itself detectable as a rename rather than as hundreds of additions. Measured
# across the real move, 61ec7587 to 38283eae: `-- findings/` alone reports 340 entries all `A`;
# `-- findings/ reviews/findings/` reports the same 340 as 7 `A` and 333 `R`. The loop takes the
# NEW path of an `R`, so the recorded set is the same either way -- which is what this case pins.

# ---- the shape rule: the unsafe call must be impossible to WRITE, not just absent -------------
#
# Five rounds of finding these one at a time produced more of them each round,
# and three of one round's four were introduced by the repairs themselves. A gate
# can only test the instances somebody imagined. So the validator routes every
# external probe, every file read and every directory listing through three
# audited helpers, and this asserts THE SHAPE of everything below the AUDITED
# HELPERS END marker.
#
# IT IS AN ALLOWLIST AND NOT A BAN LIST, because the ban list was defeated the
# round it was written. `LC_ALL=C git ls-files` walked past a command-position
# regex with no room for an assignment; `command -- git` past one with no room
# for an option; `sed -n p -- "$1"` past a reader list that named `cat` and
# `head` and not `sed`; and `read -r record<"$f"` past a redirection regex that
# wanted a space before the `<`. All four are probes below. Naming what MAY run
# has no such gaps to find: a command must be a shell builtin from the short list
# in the scanner or a function the validator itself defines, and nothing may
# redirect from a path.
#
# WHAT IT IS AND IS NOT, because the body used to claim more than this. It is a
# TEXT SCAN over one file. It bounds what is WRITTEN in the validator; it does
# not bound what bash can be made to do, and it is not a sandbox. What it buys is
# the only thing claimed for it: THE REVIEWED SURFACE IS THE AUDITED REGION,
# capped below at a size that can be read in one sitting, instead of every call
# site in a 1500-line file.
#
# THE RESIDUALS ARE LISTED RATHER THAN DENIED, and the list shortens as they are
# closed. A command word that is ENTIRELY inside quotes leaves nothing on the
# bare line to read -- `"$reader"` on its own is invisible here -- and a command
# reached through an `eval` of a string this cannot see is outside any text scan.
# Two more were on this list until the review that executed them: a command
# substitution inside `[[ … ]]`, whose words this skipped because the test itself
# holds no command, and one inside a `case` WORD, skipped up to the `)` that ends
# a label. Bash runs both, and both are caught below now.
#
# THE INSTRUMENT IS TESTED FIRST, because a rule that matches nothing would pass
# this file forever while proving nothing: each shape below is appended to a COPY
# of the validator and must be caught.
