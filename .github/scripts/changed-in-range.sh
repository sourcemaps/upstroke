# Write the two listings .github/scripts/validate-pr-branch.sh judges a pull request's DIFF
# against, from the repository in the current directory:
#
#   <out-dir>/changed-paths     every path the pull request changes, one per line, as `git diff
#                               --name-only` spells it, with rename detection OFF so that BOTH
#                               ENDPOINTS of a rename are listed and not the destination alone.
#   <out-dir>/added-findings    one line per file the pull request ADDS or RENAMES under
#                               findings/: `<severity><TAB><path>`, where <severity> is the
#                               value of the `severity:` line in the file's YAML frontmatter AT THE
#                               HEAD, or `-` where the frontmatter carries none.
#
# THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT FOUR LINES OF WORKFLOW BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE TESTED, and because the
# validator may not build it. Every external probe, file read and directory listing in
# validate-pr-branch.sh goes through three audited helpers, and .github/scripts/test-pr-policy.sh
# fails the build if anything below its AUDITED HELPERS END marker runs a command that is not a
# shell builtin or redirects from a path -- so the validator cannot run `git` or open a blob, and
# consumes these two files as LISTINGS through the same `read_file` it consumes the three finding
# listings with. The precedent is .github/scripts/findings-in-range.sh, which exists for exactly
# this reason: it was four lines of workflow, the fixtures could not reach it, and three wrong ways
# of building the candidate set each survived a frontier review.
#
# THE BOUNDARY IS THE MERGE BASE, AND EVERY MERGE BASE IS TAKEN. findings-in-range.sh argues the
# choice at length and the argument is the same one: the event's base SHA is the target branch's
# current head, which moves for reasons that have nothing to do with this pull request. Where the
# histories criss-cross there is more than one best common ancestor, and each one's diff is taken
# and the results are UNIONED -- which is the conservative direction for both listings here, since
# a wider set of changed paths can only add a path outside findings/, and a wider set of
# added files can only add a file to check.
#
# AN END THAT WILL NOT RESOLVE FAILS CLOSED rather than being dropped. A listing that is short is a
# listing that says a pull request touches less than it does, which is the direction that turns a
# refusal into an acceptance.
#
# THE TWO LISTINGS SPELL A PATH DIFFERENTLY, ON PURPOSE.
#
#   changed-paths is git's own `--name-only` output, which C-QUOTES a path holding a control
#   character or a byte outside ASCII: `"findings/\303\244.md"`, quotes and all. That keeps
#   the guarantee the listing needs -- ONE PATH PER LINE, whatever the path holds, since a newline
#   in a name is escaped rather than written. A quoted path does not begin `findings/`, so
#   the validator reads it as a path OUTSIDE the ledger and a `findings/` branch carrying one is
#   refused. That is a false refusal for a finding whose name is not ASCII, and it is the safe
#   direction: a finding's name is `P<n>_<category>_<timestamp>_<description>.md`, every byte of
#   which is ASCII, so no name this repository can hold reaches it.
#
#   added-findings carries the path RAW, because the severity comes from the file's own bytes and
#   `git cat-file blob <head>:<path>` needs the path git records rather than a quoted rendering of
#   it. A raw path can hold a newline, and one line per record is what the listing promises, so a
#   newline in an ADDED path under findings/ is refused here rather than written out to be
#   split into two records downstream.
#
# ONLY THE FILES THE DIFF ADDS OR RENAMES ARE LISTED. An existing finding must never turn somebody
# else's pull request red: a rule over the whole directory would refuse every pull request in the
# repository the day a badly named file landed, and the pull request that has to fix it along with
# them. `-M` asks for rename detection explicitly rather than inheriting `diff.renames` from
# whatever config the runner has; where it does not fire -- a rename whose content changed too much,
# or a diff over `diff.renameLimit` -- the rename is reported as an add and a delete, and the add is
# checked, which is the same answer the long way round. Copy detection is off, so a copied file is
# an add here too.

# The added and renamed paths, NUL-delimited so a name is never quoted: `--name-status -z` writes
# `<status>\0<path>\0` for an add and `<status>\0<old>\0<new>\0` for a rename, so after a status
# beginning `R` the next record is the old path and the one after it is the new one. The NEW path is
# what is checked, because that is the name the pull request leaves behind.
#
# Read from a FILE and not from a pipe or a process substitution. git's status is taken from the
# command that wrote the file, where it is a status; through `< <(git ...)` it belongs to nobody,
# and a diff that failed would read as a pull request that adds nothing. Reading from a file also
# keeps the loop in THIS shell, so the duplicate set below survives it.
#
# BOTH LEDGER PREFIXES ARE NAMED, BECAUSE `$head` IS THE CALLER'S REVISION AND NOT THIS CHECKOUT.
# The ledger moved from reviews/findings/ to findings/ on 2026-09-12 (pull request #276), and
# pr-policy.yml passes the PULL REQUEST'S OWN head SHA -- read from the API, never the queue
# commit -- to a copy of this script taken from the merge result. So every pull request whose head
# predates the move runs THIS file against a tree laid out the old way, and a pathspec naming only
# findings/ matched nothing there. `git diff` with a pathspec that matches nothing SUCCEEDS WITH
# EMPTY OUTPUT, so the `|| exit 1` above has no failure to propagate and the caller reads a pull
# request that ADDS NO FINDING.
#
# THAT IS A FALSE GREEN AND NOT A FALSE RED. Measured on a two-commit repository laid out both
# ways, identical but for the prefix: a branch filing `scratch-notes.md` and a P2_-named finding
# whose frontmatter severity is `P4` gave 2 records and `validate-pr-branch.sh` exit 1 under
# findings/, and 0 records and exit 0 -- `conforms` -- under reviews/findings/. check_added_findings
# is the only rule that reads what a pull request FILES, so an empty listing is that rule not
# running at all.
#
# RENAME DETECTION IS WHY BOTH PREFIXES ARE ONE PATHSPEC AND NOT TWO RUNS. `-M` pairs a delete with
# an add only where BOTH ends are in the diff, so naming the old prefix is what lets the move itself
# be seen as the rename it is. Measured across the move, 61ec7587 to 38283eae: `-- findings/` alone
# reports 340 entries, ALL of them `A`, because the old ends are filtered out before pairing;
# `-- findings/ reviews/findings/` reports the same 340 entries as 7 `A` and 333 `R`. The count does
# not grow -- the loop below takes the NEW path of an `R`, which is the findings/ path either way --
# so widening the pathspec adds no record here and removes none.
#
# The consumer was widened with it: check_added_findings and check_findings_confined in
# validate-pr-branch.sh accept a path under either prefix, because a record naming the old one is
# the point of this change and that function refused it as a listing built wrongly.
