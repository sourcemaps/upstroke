# Refuse a pull request whose head branch is not in the branch vocabulary.
#
# WHY A BRANCH NAME IS POLICY AND NOT TASTE. The prefix already decides two
# things that bind a merge: the effort the frontier review is run at and the
# severities the pull request must fix before it is ready. Both come from ONE
# table, scripts/lane.sh, which scripts/pr-ready-audit.sh and the review tooling
# each source; MAINTAINING.md states the rule. Until this validator existed
# every prefix outside two `codex/` shapes fell into a `feature` catch-all, so a
# branch nobody had thought about was silently assigned the most expensive
# review and the loosest fix set, and nothing said so. An unrecognised prefix
# must fail here rather than default; that refusal is the point of this file,
# and the vocabulary below is the part that has to stay true. The vocabulary
# here and the table there are the same thirteen prefixes and must stay so: a
# prefix this file admits and that table does not know has no lane at all.
#
# A lane:* label is an OUTPUT of that rule and never an input. Nothing may read
# a label to decide effort or must-fix: a label is not bound to a commit, so
# editing one would otherwise change which gates apply to a merge.
#
# THE VOCABULARY.
#
#   feature/<slug>                  new behaviour

#   docs/<slug>                     documentation only

#   findings/<slug>                 findings/ alone: filing or curating
#   fix-P<n>/<category>_<desc>      exactly one finding, n in 0..3
#   bulk-fix-P<n>/<slug>            a batch of findings, n in 2..3
#
# <slug> and <desc> are lower-case words joined by single hyphens. <category>
# is one of the eight the finding filenames and validate-pr-body.sh use; the
# list is duplicated there and the two must move together.
#
# WHY THERE IS NO fix/ PREFIX. There was one, for "a bug that is not a filed
# finding", and it is retired. It was a second way to repair something, and the
# two disagreed about whether the repair was on the record: a fix-P*/ branch
# named the finding it closed, a fix/ branch named nothing and left the reviewer
# to work out what it was for. A bug worth a branch is worth a finding, so every
# repair now goes through fix-P<n>/ and the finding exists: filed by an earlier
# pull request, or filed by this one. Resolving the name across the whole pull
# request rather than at one end is what makes the second case work, and without
# it retiring fix/ would have forced one pull request to file a finding and a
# second to repair it.
#
# findings/<slug> IS NOT ITS REPLACEMENT. It is for a pull request that touches
# findings/ and nothing else: filing what a review produced, or curating
# what is already there. It repairs no code. A branch that files a finding AND
# repairs it is a fix-P<n>/ branch, because the repair is the half that binds a
# merge and it is the half the name has to declare.
#
# WHY fix-P*/ AND bulk-fix-P*/ ARE DIFFERENT PREFIXES. A fix-P*/ branch repairs
# exactly one finding and its name resolves to that finding's file, so the
# mapping is total and this validator checks it. A batch holds many findings and
# can name none of them. Sharing one prefix would leave the check guessing which
# shape it was looking at, so they are separated and each prefix's rule is
# exact. P0 and P1 never batch, which is why bulk-fix stops at P2.
#
# THE PER-FINDING BRANCH IS A LOCK. For P2 and P3 the fix is done on the
# per-finding branch and cherry-picked into the batch; the branch existing is
# what advertises that the finding is taken, so nothing else picks it up. Those
# branches are not expected to open a pull request, but they are validated here
# anyway because one may.
#
# THE FINDING IS LOOKED FOR ACROSS THE WHOLE PULL REQUEST, NOT AT ITS TWO ENDS.
# The claim a fix-P*/ name makes is "this pull request repairs that finding".
# The finding therefore has to have EXISTED somewhere in the pull request;
# requiring it at an endpoint is a different, stricter claim, and both endpoints
# refuse a pull request that is doing exactly the right thing:
#
#   The branch point alone fails the pull request that files its own finding.
#   With no fix/ prefix, a bug that was never filed has to become a finding
#   before it can have a branch name, and a branch-point-only rule means the
#   finding has to be on master before the branch exists: one pull request to
#   file it, a second to fix it.
#
#   The head alone fails the pull request that did its job. Repairing a finding
#   DELETES its file: master carries 69 such deletions. A fix-P*/ pull request
#   that has landed its repair has no finding file left in its own tree.
#
#   BOTH ENDPOINTS TOGETHER STILL FAIL THE ONE PULL REQUEST THE PREFIX EXISTS
#   FOR: one that files the finding in commit A and repairs it in commit B,
#   deleting the file as findings/README.md requires. The branch point
#   has no finding, the head has no finding, and the file existed only in
#   between. Keeping the file to get past the check is not the answer either:
#   that leaves finished work sitting in the outstanding queue, which the ledger
#   forbids.
#
# So the caller passes the MERGE-BASE tree, the head tree, and the pull
# request's own commits; this script judges the listings it is handed and goes
# looking for no finding of its own. Each listing is a file of finding
# filenames, one per line -- LF or CRLF, a carriage return being a line ending
# and never part of a name -- or a directory to list when running by hand. They
# are taken as one SET: a filename in more than one of them is one finding and
# not two, a name that resolves in any of them resolves, and a name that matches
# two distinct findings across them is still ambiguous and still refused.
#
# THE FIRST LISTING IS THE MERGE BASE AND NOT THE TARGET BRANCH'S CURRENT HEAD.
# Rooting it at the target's current head let master decide the verdict in the
# ordinary case: two findings sharing a description at the branch point, one
# repaired by the pull request and the same one independently deleted on master,
# and an ambiguous name that was refused at exit 1 before master moved CONFORMED
# at exit 0 after it -- same head, same diff. The merge base holds under that.
#
# THAT IS A DEFAULT AND NOT A GUARANTEE, AND THIS SCRIPT PROMISES NOTHING ABOUT
# AN UNCHANGED HEAD. The merge base itself moves when master absorbs a commit
# this branch also contains, and an ambiguous name can become unambiguous with
# no push to the branch. That is the RIGHT answer: whether a description picks
# out one finding or two is a property of the LEDGER, which other pull requests
# legitimately change, and this script answers "does this name resolve to
# exactly one filed finding" AGAINST THE LISTINGS IT IS HANDED AND AGAINST
# NOTHING ELSE.
#
# THOSE LISTINGS ARE NOT THE LEDGER AS IT STANDS, and calling them that
# overstates every verdict taken here. They are the pull request's three: the
# merge-base tree, the head tree, and its own commits. A finding the TARGET
# filed after the branch point is in none of them, on a synchronize and on the
# queue entry alike, because the tree of the commit being merged is never
# listed -- replayed on a queue merge whose target had added two
# same-description findings, the name conformed at exit 0 while the queue
# commit's own findings/ named 2 findings at exit 1. So the answer is
# the narrow one: the name resolved to exactly one filed finding in the
# listings handed over, at the moment they were built. It is not a statement
# about the head, it is not a statement about the ledger a merge lands on, and
# no way of choosing the boundary would make it either.
# .github/scripts/findings-in-range.sh states the whole argument.
#
# WHY ALL THREE AND NOT JUST THE PULL REQUEST'S COMMITS. A finding the pull
# request never touched appears in none of its commits, so the merge-base tree
# is needed. The head tree looks redundant next to merge-base + commits and very
# nearly is -- but it is what a listing built from per-commit DIFFS would miss
# for a finding that entered this branch through a merge rather than through a
# commit of its own. It costs one ls-tree, and the expensive failure of this
# rule is a FALSE REFUSAL of a legitimate branch.
#
#
# A DIRECTORY LISTING IS ANSWERED OUT OF GIT'S RECORDS AND NOT OUT OF THE
# CHECKOUT. This is the rule the last five rounds were spent arriving at, and it
# is worth stating before anything else it replaces.
#
# The other way in -- the three listings the workflow builds -- reads
# `git ls-tree` and has been right every round. The directory way in used to
# answer from the filesystem, with git as a cross-check, and every round found
# another spelling of the same disagreement: a committed symlink named like a
# finding that `-f` followed; a committed symlink AT findings that `-d`
# followed; the same two under core.symlinks=false, where git materialises a
# 120000 blob as a REGULAR FILE and `-L` has nothing left to see; a sparse
# checkout whose index records findings the working tree does not hold; a
# checkout `findings` renamed and replaced by a link with the index untouched;
# and a materialised link BEHIND another link, whose target text was read as a
# file listing and resolved a finding nobody has filed. Six shapes, one defect:
# the filesystem was being asked a question only the index can answer.
#
# So the directory input LOCATES the repository and the path within it, and
# then answers from `git ls-files -s` alone: which names exist, and what each
# one is. Nothing below reads `-d`, `-e`, `-L` or a glob for a path git records
# something about, and no materialised file's BYTES are read as a listing. The
# two ways in are now one code path from the index down, so the equivalence
# this gate claims holds by construction rather than by fixture.
#
# AND WHICH REPOSITORY'S RECORDS, WHICH IS A SEVENTH SHAPE AND NOT A SEVENTH
# DEFECT. Locating the repository lands in the DEEPEST work tree the path enters,
# and for an INITIALISED SUBMODULE that is the submodule's own: its index was
# read as this repository's ledger, while the superproject records the path at
# mode 160000 -- a GITLINK, and not a directory to descend into. The walk now
# continues out of a submodule into its superproject before anything is asked
# about the path, so a recorded type decides here exactly as 120000 already does.
# locate_listing states it and measures it.
#
# WHAT THAT COSTS, STATED PLAINLY. An UNTRACKED finding file inside a tracked
# findings/ no longer counts for the directory input: the ledger is what
# is committed, and a merge gate decides about commits and never about a work
# tree. A finding its author has written and not yet added is refused by a
# by-hand run, and the answer is `git add`. The disagreement this closes ran the
# other way -- an untracked twin beside a committed finding was exit 1 `names 2
# findings` through the directory and exit 0 `conforms` through the trees -- so
# the trade is one deliberate disagreement for none.
#
# AND WHAT IT LOOSENS, WHICH IS ONE CASE. Where git records a DIRECTORY at the
# listing path and the checkout holds a symlink or a file in its place, this
# used to refuse at exit 1 while the trees resolved the name at exit 0. It now
# RESOLVES, from the index, exactly as the trees do. That is a loosening and it
# is the point: the ledger is the index, the checkout is not the ledger, and the
# two ways in must not answer differently about one commit.
#
# THE FILESYSTEM IS STILL THE WHOLE OF THE EVIDENCE IN ONE PLACE: a listing with
# no repository over it, which is how this script is run against a scratch
# directory and how most of its fixtures run, and a path inside a work tree that
# git records nothing at, under OR ABOVE -- an ordinary untracked scratch
# directory, and the temporary files a caller builds the three listings in.
# A path git records nothing at BECAUSE A COMPONENT ABOVE IT IS A BLOB is not
# one of those: no index entry and no tree entry can be named by it, so it holds
# no finding, and that is what the trees say too.
#
# A REPOSITORY GIT CANNOT READ IS A REFUSAL AND NOT A REPOSITORY THAT IS NOT
# THERE. Reading the records means asking git "is this inside a work tree?", and
# that has three answers and not two: yes, no, and "I could not tell you".
# Collapsing the third into the second is how the filesystem fallback kept
# coming back: `.git/config` unreadable, discovery exiting 128, the status
# thrown away, and a materialised symlink conforming at exit 0 with nothing
# said. Only "there is no repository here" falls back to the filesystem.
#
# WHICH OF THE THREE IT IS, IS DECIDED BY EXIT STATUS AND NEVER BY THE WORDS GIT
# USED. Git's diagnostics quote the paths it was working on, and a path is the
# caller's to choose. A repository at `.../not a git repository - fixture` whose
# `.git/config` is unreadable fails discovery with `unable to access '.../not a
# git repository - fixture/.git/config': Permission denied`, a substring test
# for git's own no-repository sentence matched inside that PATHNAME, and the
# materialised symlink conformed at exit 0 once more with empty stderr. So
# discovery failing is only permission to judge by the filesystem where there is
# no repository for it to have failed ABOUT. That is asked as a second question,
# of `git rev-parse --resolve-git-dir`, which answers by exit status, reads no
# config, and so still says YES for the repository whose config it cannot read.
# A directory named `.git` holding nothing is not a repository to it, which is
# why the question is put to git rather than to `[[ -e ]]`: a stray `/tmp/.git`
# would otherwise turn every by-hand listing under /tmp red.
#
# AND "GIT SAID NO" IS ONLY AN ABSENCE WHERE THIS CAN SEE THERE WAS NOTHING TO
# READ. That test is now made at every level of the walk and for every shape a
# `.git` takes, because it was made for some of them and the ones it missed were
# each a round's P1: an unreadable `.git` FILE; an unreadable `.git` DIRECTORY;
# an unreadable `HEAD`, `objects` or `refs` inside a `.git` this can enter
# perfectly well; and -- last round -- a `.git` FILE that reads perfectly and
# names a gitdir behind an unsearchable `.git/worktrees`, where `[[ -d ]]` on
# the target could not tell an absent directory from one it was not allowed to
# look at, so the level was called empty. A `.git` file that names a gitdir and
# that git would not resolve is now unexaminable outright: git resolves a good
# one, so a refusal there is a repository this cannot read, never an absence.
#
# A NAME THAT CANNOT BE HELD ON A LINE IS NOT A FINDING. A newline is legal in a
# filename and is the separator every listing here is built from, so the one
# separator that cannot occur in a name -- NUL -- is what git is asked for and
# what is read back; nothing converts one into the other. A name carrying a
# newline is then dropped rather than split into two: it can match no
# P<n>_<category>_<timestamp>_<description>.md, so it is no finding and can make
# no other name ambiguous, and `git ls-tree` C-quotes it into a name that
# matches nothing in the tree listings either.
#
# With no listing at all only the grammar is checked, which is how the fixtures
# exercise it without a repository. With one listing, that listing alone is the
# set: a caller that has only the merge base gets the stricter rule and says so
# by passing only the merge base.
#
# A LISTING THIS SCRIPT CANNOT READ IS A REFUSAL AND NEVER AN EMPTY SET. An
# unreadable listing that read as "no findings here" would silently narrow the
# set, and narrowing it can turn a refusal into an acceptance: two findings match
# a description and the name is ambiguous, one listing goes unreadable, one match
# is left and the name "conforms". Read failures are propagated, separately from
# an ordinary no-match.
#
# A LISTING THIS SCRIPT CANNOT READ WITHOUT LOSING SOMETHING IS THE SAME
# REFUSAL. A file listing holding a NUL is not a listing: no filename can contain
# one, so it is a caller who wrote records where lines were asked for. `$(cat …)`
# DISCARDS a NUL rather than failing on it, concatenating the record after it
# onto the one before -- one twin stopped matching, and an ambiguous name
# conformed at exit 0 where the same two names LF-delimited refused it at exit 1.
#
# THERE IS NO EXEMPTION. Every head branch is in the vocabulary above: a name
# outside it is refused whoever opened the pull request and whatever its
# number. The rule shipped with a migration list of the pull requests that
# predated it -- accepted with a warning, entries only ever removed -- and that
# list is gone. It reached zero open pull requests, and the owner ruled on
# 2026-09-09 that every head branch conforms and there is no exemption path.
# The PR_NUMBER that carried a listed entry's identity, and the file it was
# matched against, went with it.
#
# THE findings/ LIMIT IS WHAT MAKES ITS CHEAP REVIEW SAFE. `findings/<slug>` is
# reviewed at low effort (scripts/lane.sh) because a pull request on it files or
# curates findings and repairs no code. That is a claim about the DIFF and not
# about the name, so the diff is checked: a `findings/` branch whose changed
# paths include anything outside `findings/` is refused, and the
# offending paths are named. Without it the prefix is a way to have code
# reviewed at the cheapest setting there is by choosing a branch name.
#
# AND EVERY FINDING IT FILES CARRIES A SEVERITY THE LADDER KNOWS. A file the
# pull request ADDS OR RENAMES under `findings/` whose name does not
# start `P0_`, `P1_`, `P2_` or `P3_`, or whose frontmatter `severity:` is
# outside P0-P3, is refused. Severity leads a finding's filename because the
# directory sorts worst-first (findings/README.md), the lane table reads
# the severity, and the audit's must-fix set is written in those four tokens; a
# fifth severity is a finding nothing can act on. THE DIRECTORY'S OWN TWO
# DOCUMENTS ARE THE ONE EXEMPTION: `findings/README.md` and `findings/PROCESS.md`,
# by exact path, are not findings, and a move of the whole directory adds or
# renames both of them along with every finding.
#
# ONLY WHAT THE DIFF ADDS OR RENAMES IS CHECKED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
# A rule over the directory as it stands would turn every open pull request red
# the day a badly named file landed on master -- including the pull request that
# was going to fix it. What a pull request may be held to is what it does.
#
# NEITHER INPUT IS BUILT HERE. Nothing below the AUDITED HELPERS END marker may
# run a command that is not a shell builtin or redirect from a path, so this
# file cannot run `git diff` or read a blob, and .github/scripts/test-pr-policy.sh
# fails the build if it tries. .github/scripts/changed-in-range.sh builds both,
# the workflow calls it, the fixtures call it too, and they arrive here as
# LISTINGS read through `read_file` exactly as the three finding listings are.
# That is the precedent findings-in-range.sh set and the reason it exists.
#
#   changed-paths    one path per line, as `git diff --name-only` spells it.
#   added-findings   `<severity><TAB><path>` per file the diff adds or renames
#                    under findings/; `-` where the frontmatter carries
#                    no severity line.
#
# A LISTING THAT CANNOT BE READ IS A REFUSAL HERE TOO, and an EMPTY changed-path
# listing is a refusal for a `findings/` branch specifically: a pull request that
# changes nothing is not one that files or curates a finding, and "the list was
# empty" is the shape every false acceptance this file has given was wearing. An
# argument that is NOT GIVEN is a different thing from a listing that is empty --
# with no listings at all only the grammar is checked, which is how the fixtures
# and a by-hand run work -- and the workflow gives both.
#
# So this file answers the one narrow question it was written to answer: is the
# NAME in the vocabulary, does it resolve -- for a fix-P*/ name -- to exactly one
# filed finding in the listings handed over, and is what the pull request DID
# what its prefix claims. Nothing else about the pull request carrying that name
# is read here.
#
# EVERY FALSE ACCEPTANCE THIS FILE HAS GIVEN WAS A FAILED PROBE ANSWERED AS AN
# ABSENCE, AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS NOW EXACTLY ONE WAY OUT OF IT. Six review
# rounds each found more of one defect than the round before -- a git command, a
# file read or a directory listing whose status was discarded, and whose failure
# was then read as "nothing there", "empty" or "end of input", every one of which
# CONFORMS:
#
#   `nul=$?` inside `{ ...; nul=$?; }` makes the GROUP succeed, so the `||` that
#   was meant to catch a failed open never ran and every non-zero read status
#   became end-of-file: `/proc/self/mem` as a listing was exit 0 `conforms`.
#
#   A process substitution's status is not the command's, so `done < <(git
#   ls-files …)` followed by `return 0` read an unreadable `.git/index` as "git
#   records nothing at this path", and the filesystem then decided.
#
#   Testing that `.git/.` is accessible says nothing about the metadata inside
#   it, so `chmod 000 .git/HEAD` made both discovery probes exit 128, "no
#   repository" was inferred, and the fallback conformed with empty stderr.
#
#   A private copy that went UNREADABLE between the command that wrote it and the
#   read that parsed it. `cat` had copied a listing at exit 0; `read … < copy`
#   then failed to open, reported the same 1 it reports at end of input, and the
#   helper returned SUCCESS WITH EMPTY BYTES. Owning the file establishes nothing
#   about reading it.
#
#   And -- last round, IN THE HELPERS WRITTEN TO END THIS, three of them at once
#   and each at a different sub-step. The REDIRECTION that opens a capture's
#   destination reports its failure to nobody inside the group, so a copy that
#   would not open left the status at 0 and the PREVIOUS capture's bytes, sentinel
#   and all, to be parsed as this one's. `list_dir` took its names from a GLOB
#   after a separate `ls` had exited 0, so a directory made unreadable in between
#   was an empty one. And `repository_above` never looked at the NUL flag
#   read_file set for it, lost a `.git` file's gitdir pointer, and put the listing
#   back on the filesystem.
#
#   And the round after that, IN `capture`: A STEP THAT RAN AND WAS NEVER ASKED
#   HOW IT WENT. It writes a sentinel byte to each copy so a truncated capture
#   can be told from a whole one, AND CHECKED NEITHER WRITE. On a listing whose own last
#   byte is `0x01`, failing only the STDOUT sentinel -- the real builtin `printf`
#   exiting 1, `Bad file descriptor` -- left the INPUT'S trailing byte to be
#   mistaken for the marker the helper never wrote and stripped as if it were
#   that marker. A filename that was never filed appeared and MATCHED: exit 0
#   `conforms` with empty stderr, where the same listing refuses at exit 1 with
#   the write intact. A failed write there does not merely lose bytes; it
#   MANUFACTURES a finding. The marker's own status is now checked before
#   anything is read back through it.
#
#   And the round after that, IN `list_dir`: A VALUE HANDED TO A TOOL WITH AN
#   ARGUMENT GRAMMAR OF ITS OWN. A RELATIVE starting path went straight to
#   `find`, whose operands are a starting-point list followed by an EXPRESSION
#   and which tells the two apart by SPELLING. Measured on findutils 4.9.0, each
#   on a directory a caller named: `find ! -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -print0` is
#   exit 0 AND NO OUTPUT, so
#   an empty enumeration read as "this directory names no finding" and an
#   ambiguous name that the SAME listing refuses at exit 1 by its absolute
#   spelling conformed at exit 0; `find ( -mindepth 1 …` is exit 1, `invalid
#   expression`, a false red on a real listing; and `find -H -mindepth 1 …` is
#   exit 0 having enumerated the CURRENT directory, because `-H` is an option and
#   the starting-point list was then empty. `--` saves none of them -- find's
#   expression grammar begins before the operand list and no separator moves it,
#   and `find -- ! -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -print0` is exit 0 with no output too.
#   So the rule is by CONSTRUCTION and not a list of hostile spellings: that list
#   belongs to the implementation and not to us, and `)` and `,` are tokens of the
#   same grammar that findutils 4.9.0 happens to accept as paths in leading
#   position. An absolute path begins with `/`, which starts no token of it, so
#   only a relative one is prefixed.
#
#   AND THE ROUND AFTER THAT, IN THE SAME `case`: A PREFIX IS A REWRITE, AND A
#   REWRITE HAS TO ASK WHICH INPUTS IT IS REWRITING THAT IT DID NOT MEAN TO. `./`
#   is a valid thing to prepend only to a path that is ACTUALLY RELATIVE, and the
#   arm that prefixed everything failing `/*` prefixed a native Windows absolute
#   path too: `C:/…` begins with a drive designator and not a separator, so
#   `./C:/…` is no path at all. Measured in Git Bash on Windows Server 2025 --
#   bash 5.2.37, git 2.50.1.windows.1, GNU findutils 4.10.0 -- on a directory
#   inside a real `.git`, which is one of the shapes where discovery answers
#   `false` and the filesystem is the whole of the evidence: `find C:/…
#   -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -print0` is exit 0 and enumerates both names, and
#   `find ./C:/… …` is exit 1 `No such file or directory`. Whole-validator, same
#   listing, four spellings: `C:/…` and `C:\…` were REFUSED as "a directory whose
#   entries could not be listed" while `/c/…` and the relative name answered exit
#   1 `names 2 findings`. So the arm is the set of spellings that are already
#   ANCHORED -- a leading `/`, and a drive designator -- which is closed PER
#   PLATFORM where find's token set is open PER IMPLEMENTATION. Leaving a drive
#   designator unprefixed is safe on POSIX too, where `C:/x` is an ordinary
#   relative path: the prefix exists only to stop find reading a path as an
#   expression, and no token of that grammar begins with a letter. That also
#   means POSIX CANNOT WITNESS THIS HALF -- `./C:/x` names the same directory
#   there -- so the fixture asserts only that the unprefixed spelling still
#   answers alike written relative and written absolute, and the Windows run is
#   the witness.
#
#   AND THE ROUND AFTER THAT: THE ANCHORED SET WAS NAMED FROM ONE SPELLING AND
#   NOT FROM THE CLASS. `C:/…` was added and `\\server\share\…` and the
#   drive-relative `\Windows\…` were left in the prefixed arm, so the repair
#   closed the spelling it was shown and not the set the sentence above claims to
#   describe. A BACKSLASH now anchors too, which is both of those at once, and the
#   three arms are every spelling Windows roots a path with: `/…` and `/c/…`,
#   `C:\…` and `C:/…`, `\\server\share\…` and `\Windows\…`. Safe on POSIX by
#   the same argument as the drive designator -- no token of find's grammar begins
#   with a backslash either, and a POSIX directory named `\Windows` enumerates
#   from its bare relative spelling: measured on findutils 4.9.0, exit 0 naming
#   `\Windows/inside`.
#
#   ABSOLUTISING THE STARTING PATH INSTEAD WOULD NOT CLOSE THIS CLASS, and it was
#   asked. The bang finding offered it and its evidence is right that an absolute
#   path cannot parse as an expression -- but `${PWD%/}/$dir` has to decide WHICH
#   paths are relative for exactly the same reason `./$dir` does, and its failure
#   on the ones it gets wrong is identical: `/c/repo/C:/x` names nothing where
#   `./C:/x` names nothing. It would move this decision from one that needs no
#   platform test to one that does, because "is already anchored" is closed per
#   platform while "no find token begins with this" is closed per grammar. The
#   one construction that needs no classification at all -- appending `/.`, so the
#   string can be no exact token -- does not close it either: measured on the same
#   findutils, `-name/.` is exit 1 `unknown predicate`, and a SYMLINK to a
#   directory goes from enumerating nothing to enumerating its target, which is a
#   different answer and not a repair.
#
#   AND THE ROUND AFTER THAT: THE SAME DEFECT WAS LIVE ON A THIRD ARM, AND THE
#   ANSWER IS NOT A THIRD ARM. Three rounds had each taught ONE walk ONE more
#   spelling -- the drive root, then the anchored set -- while FOUR separate
#   `${x%/*}` strips decided what "one component shorter" meant, and the ascent's
#   was still forward-slash only: `C:\repo\findings` and `\\server\share\findings`
#   strip to themselves there, the walk reads "did not shorten" as "is a top", and
#   THE ASCENT NEVER RUNS. That is the same false green the forward-slash spelling
#   had a round earlier, on the arm nobody had been shown yet, and a fourth
#   spelling would have been a fourth round. `path_parent` is now the only place
#   that decides it and all four walks go through it; its header states the rule,
#   the roots, the UNC share and why a POSIX path keeps its own separator set.
#
#   THE THREE SITES THAT SHARE THE VOCABULARY ASK THREE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, and
#   that is why their bodies differ and should. `list_dir` asks whether a spelling
#   is ALREADY ANCHORED so that a `./` prefix would break it -- closed PER GRAMMAR,
#   the same answer for all three arms, so its body does nothing for all three.
#   `locate_listing` asks whether a spelling HAS A TOP OF ITS OWN -- closed PER
#   PLATFORM, so `/` is anchored everywhere while `\…` and `C:…` are anchored only
#   where they name what they name, which is the `-ef` test and is why those two
#   arms are together and `/` is apart. `path_parent` asks WHICH BYTES DIVIDE THE
#   COMPONENTS, and answers it from the same three arms. One vocabulary, three
#   questions, each stated -- rather than three bodies that differ because of
#   which round met which spelling.
#
#   TWO OTHER SITES READ A NATIVE WINDOWS ABSOLUTE PATH AS A RELATIVE ONE, AND ONE
#   OF THEM IS NOW REPAIRED. `repository_above` joined `${PWD%/}/$dir` onto
#   anything not beginning with `/` so its walk had a top to stop at; the ascent
#   then made GIT hand it a native parent, and the false red stopped needing a
#   native spelling from the caller to reach it at all. The join has moved to
#   `locate_listing`, which roots the caller's anchor once -- AGAINST A SET THAT IS
#   NOT THIS ONE, and reading this one's answer as that one's was a false green:
#   "can this spelling parse as a find expression" is closed PER GRAMMAR, "does
#   this spelling have a top of its own" is closed PER PLATFORM, and the second
#   question with the first's three arms left every POSIX listing spelled `C:/…`
#   or `\…` unrooted. See that function's own paragraphs. The walk there has a
#   root test that is not `/`. Measured on the same guest: a clean standalone repository, one
#   committed finding at its root, spelled `.`, exit 1 `git could not say whether
#   'C:/Users/…' is inside a work tree` before and exit 0 `conforms` after; and a
#   LOOSE directory holding two findings, in no repository at all, exit 1 `git
#   could not say what it records for 'C:/…'` before and exit 1 `names 2 findings`
#   -- the real verdict -- after, for `C:/…`, `C:\…` and `\\localhost\C$\…` alike.
#
#   THE SITE THAT IS NOT REPAIRED is `locate_listing`'s COMPONENT CHAIN, built from
#   `${PWD}/$path` so it holds the components the caller named plus the ones the
#   shell is standing in. Rooting that chain natively is not the same one-line
#   decision: its prefix arithmetic is `/`-rooted throughout and a drive root would
#   need a terminator in the chain walk as well as in this test, and skipping the
#   join for a drive designator would truncate a POSIX chain over a directory
#   legitimately named `C:`. Measured on the same guest it is a FALSE RED and not a
#   false green: a repository's own root spelled `C:/…` refuses as "no part of the
#   path as it was written names that root", where `/c/…` and `.` both answer.
#
#   WHAT THAT CHAIN DID TAKE is the join itself: `$PWD` reaches it and the anchor
#   with its trailing separator removed, because run from `/` the join spells
#   `//findings` and a LEADING RUN OF TWO SEPARATORS is how a UNC path is written.
#   `path_parent` stops at a share root, so a manufactured one would make
#   `//a/b` a top and hide a repository at `/a`. The chain matches by INODE and
#   cannot care which spelling it holds; the anchor walks, and does.
#
#   AND `normalise_listing_path` IS `/`-ONLY ON PURPOSE, which is the other place
#   a separator is read. It canonicalises THE CALLER'S OWN TEXT -- a listing
#   spelled `findings/.` is the directory `findings` -- where the walks work on a
#   path that has been ROOTED and whose separator set the rooting decides. A
#   backslash is a legal byte in a POSIX filename, so splitting the caller's text
#   on one would break a directory legitimately named `a\b`. The cost is that a
#   NATIVE spelling with a trailing backslash arrives uncanonicalised, and
#   `path_parent` takes it off rather than reading the empty last component as a
#   root: one directory, one verdict, which is the property that rule exists for.
#
# Three helpers were not a chokepoint while each had its own way to bytes, so
# there is ONE CAPTURE PRIMITIVE and they are its callers. `git_probe` is the
# only place this file runs git, `read_file` the only place it opens a file for
# reading, `list_dir` the only place it enumerates a directory -- and `capture`
# is the only place any of the three obtains a byte.
# .github/scripts/test-pr-policy.sh FAILS THE BUILD if anything below the
# AUDITED HELPERS END marker runs a command that is not a shell builtin or a
# function defined in this file, or redirects from a path. That is a text scan
# over one file and it bounds what is WRITTEN here rather than what bash can be
# made to do; what it buys is that the reviewed surface is the audited region,
# and the region is capped at a size that can be read in one sitting.
#
# `git_probe`'s contract is the part that matters: the caller ENUMERATES the exit
# statuses it is prepared to read as answers, and any other status refuses the
# whole run. "There is no repository here" is an answer at a call site that says
# so; 128 from metadata git could not read never is, and the two are the same
# status. Distinguishing them is the caller's job and this makes the caller do
# it, because a helper that returned "no records" for both is the defect above.
#
# `read_file`'s contract is the other half: the caller's path is OPENED ONCE, by
# this shell, and copied to a private file whose read status is taken from the
# copying command rather than from a builtin that reports end-of-input and a
# read error with the same 1. Nothing parses the caller's path a second time --
# a path is not a value and can hold different bytes at every open -- and the
# copy is in a directory this script made, so no rename can land between the
# check and the parse. THAT THE COPY ITSELF WAS READ IS CHECKED and not assumed:
# every private file ends with a sentinel byte, and a read that does not reach it
# is a failure whoever owns the file. AND ITS WHOLE ANSWER IS A STATUS: 0, 1, 2
# and 3, where 3 is a NUL in the bytes. That was a flag until a caller ignored
# it, and a flag a caller may ignore is not a contract.
#
# A PATH IS NORMALISED BEFORE IT IS JUDGED. `findings`,
# `findings/`, `findings/.`, `<repo>//findings` and
# `<repo>/./findings` are one listing, and they answered differently: appending
# `/.` moved the question from `findings` to `.`, and a committed symlink at
# `findings` that the plain spelling refused at exit 1 conformed at exit
# 0 with three characters added. The spelling is reduced to components first,
# and the path the ledger is asked about is built from THOSE components -- never
# from where the filesystem takes them, which is the whole of why an ancestor
# that is a link can no longer change the answer.
set -euo pipefail
export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH"

# The entries of a DIRECTORY with no repository over it are read with a GLOB,
# because a newline is legal in a filename and `ls` writes one name per line.
# These two settings are what keep that glob honest, and it is the only one in
# this file: a pattern that matches nothing has to be an empty list rather than
# the pattern itself -- `dir/*` standing for itself is a name that is not there
# -- and a GLOBIGNORE that matches drops names from the expansion in silence,
# which is the narrowing every rule below refuses.
#
# Measured on bash 5.2.21 rather than assumed, because the obvious sentence is
# wrong: a GLOBIGNORE INHERITED from the environment is INERT, and stays inert
# until something assigns it -- `GLOBIGNORE="$GLOBIGNORE"` is enough to wake it,
# and then `dir/*` loses every name the pattern matches. The value is inherited
# whether or not it is honoured, so it is unset here rather than left lying
# where an assignment could wake it. `unset` leaves the glob complete; that was

<slug> and <desc> are lower-case words joined by single hyphens, e.g.
`feature/pr9-repair-execution`. <category> is one of correctness,
crash-consistency, security-trust, portability, liveness, performance,
compatibility, docs-contract, and a fix-P*/ branch names one finding:

  findings/P1_correctness_202609040301_pid-identity-under-a-host-wildcard-waiter.md
  fix-P1/correctness_pid-identity-under-a-host-wildcard-waiter

That finding is looked for anywhere in this pull request, not just at its two
ends: the merge-base tree, the head tree, and every commit between them. A
repair that deleted the file is resolved by the merge base; a pull request that
files the finding and repairs it in one go is resolved by its own commits,
whichever one the file lived in. Only a regular file git RECORDS is a finding: a
directory or a symlink carrying a finding's name is not one, and neither is a
file the checkout holds and the index does not.

There is no fix/<slug> prefix. A bug worth a branch is worth a finding, so file
the finding and branch fix-P<n>/ after it. findings/<slug> is for a pull request
that touches findings/ and nothing else; it is not somewhere to put a
repair. That limit is checked against the pull request's own diff, not taken on
trust: a findings/ branch changing a path outside findings/ is refused,
and the paths are named. It is what makes that prefix's cheap review safe.

A file this pull request ADDS OR RENAMES under findings/ is a finding:
its name starts P0_, P1_, P2_ or P3_, and its frontmatter severity: is one of
P0, P1, P2 and P3. Files the diff leaves alone are not checked, so a name
already on master never turns another pull request red. findings/README.md
and findings/PROCESS.md, the directory's own documents, are the one exemption,
by exact path.

There is deliberately no prefix for a `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `security` or
`build` change even though those are valid title types. If you need one, that is
a gap in the vocabulary to raise rather than a name to work around: say so and
the rule changes in MAINTAINING.md.

# rounds:
#
#   1. THE DESTINATION OPENED. A redirection on a command group reports its
#      failure to nobody inside the group, so `{ cmd || rc=$?; } > copy` over an
#      unwritable copy leaves `rc` at 0 -- and the PREVIOUS capture's bytes in
#      the file, sentinel and all. The open here is `exec`, whose status is a
#      status, and it truncates, so a destination that opens holds nothing from
#      before.
#   2. The producer ran, and ITS status is `capture_status`, for the caller to
#      enumerate rather than for this to interpret.
#   3. BOTH SENTINELS WERE WRITTEN. The marker is this primitive's OWN write, its
#      status was the one nobody read, and the cost was a finding nobody filed.
#   4. Both copies read back as far as their sentinel.
#   5. Nothing is handed back unless 1 to 4 held. `capture_records` and
#      `capture_tail` are the producer's stdout; `capture_err` is its stderr past
#      the last NUL, which for the text git writes is all of it, and is QUOTED in

#
# THE ONE DEFINITION OF SHORTENING A PATH, because there were four and they had
# been repaired one spelling at a time. `repository_above`, `enclosing_work_tree`
# and `locate_listing`'s two walks each wrote their own `${x%/*}`, and each round
# taught ONE of them ONE more spelling: round 4 gave two of them a drive root,
# round 6 gave the anchor an anchored set, and the ascent was still stripping a
# FORWARD SLASH ONLY. On `C:\repo\findings` or `\\server\share\findings` that
# removes NOTHING, so the strip did not shorten the path, the walk read "did not
# shorten" as "is a top", and the ascent never ran -- the same false green the
# forward-slash spelling had before round 6, on the arm nobody had been shown
# yet. One rule in one place is what stops a fourth spelling being a fourth
# round, and it is the rule these four sites now share.
#
# WHICH SEPARATORS A PATH IS WRITTEN WITH IS DECIDED BY HOW IT IS ROOTED, and
# that needs no platform test. A BACKSLASH IS A LEGAL BYTE IN A POSIX FILENAME,
# so a class that always spelled both would answer `/tmp/we\ird/x` with `/tmp/we`
# -- a directory that is not there, which `repository_above` reads as metadata it
# cannot examine and REFUSES, a false red on an ordinary POSIX listing. A path
# that begins with a backslash or with a drive designator is one WINDOWS rooted,
# and only there do both separators divide components; every other path reaching
# these walks was rooted with `/`, by `$PWD` or by `--show-toplevel` or by being
# written that way.
#
# IT IS THE SAME THREE-ARM VOCABULARY `list_dir` AND `locate_listing` TEST, ASKED
# A THIRD QUESTION, and that is why the three sites do not have the same body.
# `list_dir` asks whether a spelling is already anchored so that a `./` prefix
# would break it, which is closed PER GRAMMAR and is the same answer for all
# three arms -- so its body does nothing for all three. `locate_listing` asks
# whether a spelling has a top of its own, which is closed PER PLATFORM, so `/`
# is anchored everywhere while `\…` and `C:…` are anchored only where they name
# what they name -- which is the `-ef` test, and is why those two arms are
# together and `/` is apart. THIS asks which bytes divide the path's components,
# and answers it from the same three arms. Three questions, one vocabulary,
# stated rather than left to whichever round met which spelling.
#
# A ROOT IS SPELLED WITH ITS OWN SEPARATOR AND IS A TOP. `/repo` shortens to `/`,
# `C:/repo` to `C:/`, `C:\repo` to `C:\` -- never to `C:`, which names the
# drive's CURRENT directory -- and `\Windows` to `\`. Executed natively on
# Windows Server 2025 from inside a clean repository directly under `C:/`: `git
# -C C: rev-parse --show-toplevel` exits 0 and answers THAT REPOSITORY, where
# `git -C C:/ rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` exits 128, so a walk that landed
# on `C:` read the repository as its own container and refused it. The POSIX half
# is not hypothetical either: `/repo` strips to the EMPTY STRING, and `git -C ''`
# is a documented no-op that answers about the process's own current directory.
# A root that loses its separator stops naming a root.
#
# AND A PATH WITH NO SEPARATOR LEFT TO STRIP IS A TOP because it cannot be
# shortened at all: `C:`, `.` and `findings` are each drive- or
# directory-relative, and respelling any of them as a root would move the
# question to another directory -- this defect the other way round.
#
# WHICH IS WHY THE RESPELLING IS ASKED OF A NATIVE PATH AND NOT OF EVERY PATH.
# What is left when the last separator goes is a root when there is nothing
# before it -- `/repo` -- and, on a WINDOWS-rooted path, when what is left holds
# no separator, which there is exactly the drive designator: a `\`-rooted path
# leaves either nothing or something with a separator in it, and a `C:`-rooted
# one leaves `C:` or nothing. On a `/`-rooted path the same test would respell
# the ordinary relative `p` in `p/q` as `p/`, which names the same directory and
# is merely a spelling -- but it is a spelling this hands to git, and a rule that
# is exact costs nothing over one that is nearly right.
#
# AND A UNC PATH'S TOP IS ITS SHARE, which is the one place the arithmetic alone
# gets it wrong. `\\server\share` shortens to `\\server`, which names no
# directory on any host: `repository_above` cannot stat it, reads that as a
# `.git` it cannot examine, and refuses -- so an ordinary listing on a share,
# outside any repository, would go from the filesystem's answer to a refusal. The
# share IS the top. Both spellings arrive: a caller writes `\\server\share\…`
# and git answers `//server/share/…`.
#
# A TRAILING SEPARATOR IS NOT A COMPONENT, because one directory must not have
# two verdicts. `normalise_listing_path` takes it off a `/` spelling before any
# of this, and knows no other separator, so `C:\repo\findings\` would otherwise
# have reached here as a path with an empty last component and been read as a
# root -- the ascent skipped, on a spelling of a listing whose other spelling
# ascends. It comes off here while something with a separator in it is left,
# which is what keeps `/`, `C:\` and `\` spelled as the roots they are.

# repository_above <directory>: is there a repository for git to have failed
# ABOUT? A `.git` at that directory or at any ancestor, and `git rev-parse
# --resolve-git-dir` -- which answers by EXIT STATUS, prints what this never
# reads, and needs no config, so it still says yes for the repository whose
# config git could not read -- deciding whether each one is a repository at all.
# Asking git rather than `[[ -e ]]` is what keeps an empty directory named
# `.git` from being one: a stray /tmp/.git would otherwise refuse every by-hand
# listing under /tmp, and that is a false red on a legitimate branch.
#
# THE ANSWER IS ONE OF THREE AND NEVER ONE OF TWO: 0 a repository, 1 none, and
# 2 "there is a repository here and this cannot examine it". Treating every
# unsuccessful resolution as an absence is the discarded read failure one level
# up, one level down, and it has now been measured four ways: an unreadable
# `.git` FILE, an unreadable `.git` DIRECTORY, an unreadable `HEAD`, `objects` or
# `refs` INSIDE a `.git` this can enter perfectly well, and a `.git` FILE that
# reads perfectly and names a gitdir behind an unsearchable `.git/worktrees`.
# Metadata that is MISSING may fall back; metadata that CANNOT BE EXAMINED must
# refuse.
#
# WHICH OF THOSE THREE IT IS, IS NOT READ OUT OF GIT'S MESSAGE. Every failure
# here is exit 128 whatever the reason -- `not a gitdir` for a nonexistent
# `.git`, for an empty directory named `.git`, for an unreadable `.git` DIRECTORY
# and for a `.git` whose HEAD cannot be read alike -- and git's words quote the
# caller's own pathname, which is how an earlier repair was defeated. So the
# third answer comes from THIS asking the filesystem the two questions it can
# answer for itself: can the thing named `.git` be looked into or read at all,
# and if it can, does it hold what a repository holds?
#
# A `.git` FILE THAT NAMES A GITDIR AND THAT GIT WOULD NOT RESOLVE IS
# UNEXAMINABLE OUTRIGHT. That is the fourth shape and the one `[[ -d ]]` could
# not see: with the main repository's `.git/worktrees` unsearchable, the linked
# worktree's `.git` file reads perfectly, names its gitdir, and `[[ -d <target>
# ]]` is FALSE -- not because the target is absent but because nothing may stat
# through the directory above it. The two cases are indistinguishable from here
# and only one of them is an absence, so neither is treated as one: git resolves
# a healthy `.git` file, and a refusal on one that names a gitdir is a repository
# this cannot read.
#
# A GIT_DIR or GIT_WORK_TREE in the environment points git at an index this walk
# cannot reach, so it counts as a repository in play and the answer is yes.
#
# THE PATH MUST ARRIVE ROOTED AND THIS NO LONGER ROOTS IT, because the join it
# used to make was `${PWD%/}/$dir` for anything not beginning with `/` -- true of
# every path a POSIX caller writes, and FALSE of the native `C:/…` that
# `rev-parse --show-toplevel` answers with on Windows. The ascent then handed this
# such a parent and the join made `/c/…/repo/C:/…`, which names nothing, so the
# walk reported a `.git` it could not examine and the run refused: a CLEAN
# STANDALONE REPOSITORY, one committed finding at its root, spelled `.`, went from
# `conforms` to exit 1 -- and nothing the caller wrote was native. Measured in Git
# Bash on Windows Server 2025, bash 5.2.37, git 2.50.1.windows.1: exit 1 `git
# could not say whether 'C:/Users/…' is inside a work tree` at the previous head,
# exit 0 `conforms` with the join gone.
#
# Sanitising what a CALLER passes in does not reach what GIT hands back, so the
# join moved to the one caller that knows how its path was spelled rather than
# being taught a second spelling here. `locate_listing` roots the caller's anchor
# once, against the same anchored set list_dir tests, and `enclosing_work_tree`
# walks what `--show-toplevel` answered. Both are rooted before they arrive.
#
# THE WALK THEN NEEDS A ROOT IT CAN RECOGNISE that is not `/`: stripping a
# component off `C:` leaves `C:`, so the `== /` test never fires and the loop
# would not end. A strip that does not shorten the path IS the root of whatever
# rooted it, and that is the second test below. Measured by driving this function
# alone with `C:/y` under a stubbed `git_probe`: it returns 1, and with that test
# removed it does not return at all.

# enclosing_work_tree <work-tree root> <listing, for the message>: the root of

# is one is NOT KNOWN, and that is never read as an absence.
#
# WHY THE QUESTION IS PUT TO THE PARENT DIRECTORY AND NOT TO GIT'S SUBMODULE
# QUERY. `rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree` answers "which repository
# records this one" in a single call, and answers it EMPTY for three different
# worlds: there is no repository above; there is one and it records nothing
# here; and there is one whose index could not be read. Measured on a
# superproject recording `findings` at mode 160000, with `chmod 000` on its
# `.git/index`: `git -C <super> ls-files -s` exits 128 `Permission denied`, that
# query exits 0 with EMPTY STDOUT AND EMPTY STDERR, and the listing was then
# answered out of the submodule's own index -- exit 0 `conforms`, on the
# checkout the same validator refuses at exit 1 the moment the index is readable
# again. THAT QUERY'S SUCCESSFUL EMPTY ANSWER IS INSUFFICIENT: an empty success
# is not evidence of absence, which is the shape a producer's exit status not
# being evidence its output was consumed already has.
#
# So the question is put to two things that FAIL when the look fails. Git's own
# discovery from the parent directory says where the containing work tree is and
# exits non-zero when it cannot say; `repository_above` then decides whether
# that non-zero is an absence, and decides it from the FILESYSTEM rather than
# from git's status -- it is the helper that already separates "no repository"
# from "a repository this cannot examine" in four measured shapes. `chmod 000`
# on the superproject's `.git` DIRECTORY rather than on its index is the second
# of those: discovery exits 128, `repository_above` answers 2, and this refuses
# where the submodule query answered empty and conformed.

  # An ANCHOR to ask git from: the deepest ancestor of the listing this can
  # enter. Entering is a test and nothing else -- git chdirs for itself and
  # resolves its own physical path -- so no resolved path is carried between
  # commands, which is what `/proc/self` breaks.
  #
  # IT IS ROOTED ONCE, HERE, AND THE ANCHORED SET IS NOT THE ONE `list_dir` TESTS.
  # The ascent below and `repository_above` both need a path with a top to stop
  # at, and both used to be handed the caller's own spelling and join `$PWD` onto
  # anything not beginning with `/` -- which is every path a POSIX caller writes,
  # and NOT the native `C:/…` a Windows caller may write or git may answer with.
  # One join, in the one place that knows how the path was spelled.
  #
  # THE TWO FUNCTIONS ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND BORROWING THE ANSWER WAS THE
  # DEFECT. `list_dir` asks WHETHER A SPELLING CAN PARSE AS A `find` EXPRESSION,
  # and that is closed PER GRAMMAR: no token of find's begins with `/`, with a
  # backslash, or with a letter and a colon, on any platform, so leaving those
  # three arms unprefixed is right on both and costs nothing on POSIX, where
  # `./C:/x` names the same directory as `C:/x`. THIS asks whether a spelling HAS
  # A TOP OF ITS OWN, and that is closed PER PLATFORM: `C:/holder` and `\weird`
  # are anchored on Windows and are ORDINARY RELATIVE NAMES on POSIX. The same
  # three arms were written here, they matched and did nothing, and every such
  # POSIX listing was left UNROOTED -- so the ascent ran out of separators at
  # `C:` and reported no repository above a directory that has one.
  #
  # THAT WAS A FALSE GREEN AND THE PARAGRAPH THAT STOOD HERE DENIED IT. It said
  # the cost was "the ascent not reaching as far as it could, never an answer
  # taken from the wrong repository, because the walk that stops early reports NO
  # repository above and the listing keeps its own index". The last clause is
  # where it fails: a listing INSIDE A BARE REPOSITORY has no index of its own,
  # so "keeps its own index" degrades to "is answered by the filesystem", which
  # is the one world that counts names git records nothing for. Measured twice,
  # from opposite directions:
  #
  #   A plain directory `holder` inside an IGNORED BARE REPOSITORY named `C:`, in
  #   a work tree that records nothing under it, holding one finding that matches
  #   the branch: `C:/holder` exit 0 `conforms`, and the same directory spelled
  #   absolutely exit 1 `git records nothing at …`. Two spellings of one
  #   directory, two verdicts. It answers that way at `231c1aad` too, so the
  #   unrooted anchor did not introduce it -- it carried it forward.
  #
  #   A TRACKED `C:` holding two findings of one description, the second marked
  #   `skip-worktree` with its checkout copy removed and `.git/config` unreadable
  #   so discovery exits 128: `C:` exit 0 `conforms` where the records say `names
  #   2 findings`, the absolute spelling exit 1, and `231c1aad` exit 1. This one
  #   arrived with the join's move out of `repository_above`, which used to root
  #   `C:` on the way past; reversing that commit restores the refusal.
  #
  # THE JOIN IS MADE WHERE IT PROVABLY CHANGES NOTHING, and that needs no platform
  # test at all. `$anchor` and `${PWD}/$anchor` ARE THE SAME DIRECTORY exactly
  # when the spelling is relative, and the filesystem answers that: on POSIX
  # `C:/holder` is `${PWD}/C:/holder` and `-ef` says so, while on Windows no path
  # component may hold a `:` or a backslash, so the joined spelling names nothing
  # and `-ef` is false. The join can therefore only ever SUPPLY A TOP; it can
  # never move the anchor to another directory, which is what a bare join did to
  # the native spelling and what this arm doing nothing did to the POSIX one.
  #
  # A SPELLING THAT NAMES NOTHING IS LEFT AS IT WAS, and no answer rests on it:
  # the walk below may then stop early, but `read_listing` has no directory to
  # enumerate and refuses, where a false green needs a listing that is really
  # there. `-ef` stats in THIS shell, so `/proc/self` is the same directory in
  # both operands -- and reaches neither, being absolute.
  #
  # THE SHELL'S OWN DIRECTORY IS JOINED WITHOUT DOUBLING THE SEPARATOR, and that
  # is not tidiness. Run from `/`, `${PWD}/$path` is `//findings`, and a LEADING
  # RUN OF TWO SEPARATORS is how a UNC path is spelled -- `path_parent` reads
  # `//server/share` as a share root and stops there, so a join that manufactured
  # one would make `//a/b` a top and hide a repository at `/a`. A trailing
  # separator comes off `$PWD` instead; `/` becomes the empty string and the join
  # spells `/a/b`. `$PWD` is POSIX-spelled even in Git Bash, so `/` is the only
  # separator this has to take off.

  # THE ROOT IS MATCHED BY INODE AND THE PATH THROUGH IT BY RECORDED MODE, and

  # symlink, so with `loop` a committed symlink to the work tree's own root
  # the prefix `<repo>/loop` IS that root by inode: handed `<repo>/loop/elsewhere`,
  # taking the deepest match named the listing `elsewhere`, answered it out of
  # the root's own `elsewhere/`, and walked straight past the 120000 the index
  # records for `loop`. On a clean checkout of that commit the three tree
  # listings hold no finding under `findings/` and refuse at exit 1; the
  # directory conformed at exit 0.
  #
  # So the root is the SHALLOWEST prefix that is it, and then the caller's
  # components are walked one at a time. A DEEPER prefix may be the root again --
  # `../../repo/findings` spelled from inside `repo/src` comes back
  # to it, and the shortest name is the one the index can hold -- but the walk
  # reaches that re-entry only THROUGH COMPONENTS THE RECORDS CALL DIRECTORIES.
  # A component recorded as anything else, or recorded as nothing at all, stops
  # the walk where it stands: no index entry is named by a path through it, the
  # longer name stays, and recorded_kind_of is what says so.
  #
  # A `.` or a `..` is stepped over rather than asked about. Neither names an
  # index entry, and a segment holding one is not a path git can be asked about
  # at all -- `a/..` is `a`'s parent only when `a` is a directory. They reach
  # here only from the leading `..` of a spelling like `../../repo/src`,
  # which is an ordinary one.
  #
  # AND AN EMPTY NAME IS NOT A LISTING'S NAME, WHICH IS WHERE THE QUESTION MOVES
  # TO ANOTHER REPOSITORY. The name below comes out empty exactly where the
  # listing IS a work tree's own root, and the empty path names THE WHOLE OF
  # THAT REPOSITORY'S INDEX -- every entry it holds, read as this repository's
  # ledger. For an INITIALISED SUBMODULE at `findings` that is what happened:
  # discovery lands in the DEEPEST work tree the path enters, `rev-parse
  # --show-toplevel` from inside `<super>/findings` answers `<super>/findings`,
  # and the submodule's entries were counted as findings while the superproject
  # records the path at mode 160000 -- a GITLINK, which is a recorded type and
  # not a directory to descend into. Measured on a clean checkout -- `git status
  # --porcelain` exit 0 and empty -- of a superproject recording `findings` at
  # 160000 with a finding-shaped file at the submodule's root: the three tree
  # listings refuse at exit 1 `names no finding` and the same checkout's
  # `findings` DIRECTORY conformed at exit 0.
  #
  # Answering from the repository that RECORDS that root is what puts 160000
  # under the rule that already decides the other three: 100644 and 100755 are a
  # file listing, 120000 is neither a listing nor a finding, and 160000 joins
  # them at the same place -- recorded_kind_of sees the gitlink AT the path and
  # reports a blob at mode 160000, or sees it ABOVE the path and reports the path
  # unnameable. Both are what a tree listing of the same commit says for the same
  # path.
  #
  # THE EMPTY NAME IS THE WHOLE OF THE CONDITION, AND THAT IS THE HALF THE FIRST
  # CUT OF THIS GOT WRONG. It ascended out of EVERY submodule, whatever the
  # listing was called inside it, and so threw away the ledger of a project that
  # simply lives in one. Measured with the project itself an initialised
  # submodule at `host/project`, its base holding one finding and its head
  # holding another of the same description -- both checkouts clean -- and the
  # validator run from `project` with its ordinary `findings/`: the merge-base
  # listing plus that directory answered exit 0 `conforms` where the same state
  # through the three generated tree listings answered exit 1 `names 2
  # findings`, and the directory alone answered exit 1 `names no finding` where
  # the project's own ledger holds one. A false green, a false red, and two
  # EQUIVALENT INPUTS disagreeing about one commit. A listing INSIDE a work tree
  # is named by that work tree's index and nothing above it is asked, which is
  # the case an ordinary project is, and it is the case this walk never enters.
  #
  # THE ASCENT REPEATS AND DOES NOT STOP AT THE FIRST REPOSITORY THAT DISCLAIMS A
  # PARENT. An ordinary nested repository inside a submodule is recorded by
  # nothing -- the submodule's index holds no entry for it -- and the gitlink
  # that blocks it is one level further out: with `<super>/findings` a clean
  # 160000 and an ignored repository at `<super>/findings/nested` holding a
  # finding-shaped file at its own root, the listing conformed at exit 0 while
  # the same commit's three tree listings refused at exit 1 `names no finding`.
  # So `walker` is how far out the ascent has got and `answering` is the
  # OUTERMOST work tree whose records NAME THE LISTING ROOT -- never whatever the
  # walk has reached, which is the drift the loop below is written against. A
  # repository nothing above records keeps its own index, exactly as before, and
  # the ascent above it only looks.
  #
  # WHAT IT COSTS, counted with GIT_TRACE on this tree rather than read off the
  # code: nothing at all unless the listing is a work tree's own root, because
  # the name is worked out FIRST and a non-empty one ends this before a single
  # call is made. An ordinary repository's `findings/` directory with no
  # repository above it goes from 4 git invocations to 3 -- the submodule query
  # the previous head made unconditionally is gone -- and the five files
  # .github/workflows/pr-policy.yml builds under RUNNER_TEMP and hands in make
  # the same 27 in a byte-identical sequence, because nothing records them and
  # they return above without reaching here. A listing that IS a submodule's root
  # pays for the ascent: 6 invocations become 14, seven of them `repository_above`
  # walking to `/` to decide that git's silence about a repository above is an
  # absence and not a failure to look. An ordinary repository nested under a
  # gitlink goes from 5 to 18, which is that walk at two levels.
